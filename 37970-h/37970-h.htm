<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>This collection of one-act plays appears because of an increasingly
large demand for such a volume. The plays have been selected and the
Introduction prepared to meet the need of the student or teacher who
desires to acquaint himself with the one-act play as a specific dramatic
form.</p>

<p>The plays included have been selected with this need in mind.
Accordingly, emphasis has been placed upon the wholesome and uplifting
rather than upon the sordid and the ultra-realistic. The unduly
sentimental, the strikingly melodramatic, and the play of questionable
moral problems, has been consciously avoided. Comedies, tragedies,
farces, and melodramas have been included; but the chief concern has
been that each play should be good, dramatic art.</p>

<p>The <i>Dramatic Analysis and Construction of the One-Act Play</i>, which
appears in the Introduction, also has been prepared for the student or
teacher. This outline-analysis and the plays in this volume are
sufficient material, if carefully studied, for an understanding and
appreciation of the one-act play.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION<br />
<br /><small>THE ONE-ACT PLAY AS A SPECIFIC DRAMATIC TYPE</small></h2>

<p>The one-act play is with us and is asking for consideration. It is
challenging our attention whether we will or no. In both Europe and
America it is one of the conspicuous factors in present-day dramatic
activity. Theatre managers, stage designers, actors, playwrights, and
professors in universities recognize its presence as a vital force.
Professional theatre folk and amateurs especially are devoting zestful
energy both to the writing and to the producing of this shorter form of
drama.</p>

<p>The one-act play is claiming recognition as a specific dramatic type. It
may be said that, as an art form, it has achieved that distinction. The
short story, as every one knows, was once an embryo and an experiment;
but few nowadays would care to hold that it has not developed into a
specific and worthy literary form. This shorter form of prose fiction
was once apologetic, and that not so many years ago; but it has come
into its own and now is recognized as a distinct type of prose
narrative. The one-act play, like the short story, also has come into
its own. No longer is it wholly an experiment. Indeed, it is succeeding
in high places. The one-act play is taking its place among the
significant types of dramatic and literary expression.</p>

<p>Artistically and technically considered, the one-act play is quite as
much a distinctive dramatic problem as the longer play. In writing
either, the playwright aims so to handle his material that he will get
his central intent to his audience and will provoke their interest and
emotional response thereto. Both aim<a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a> at a singleness of impression and
dramatic effect; both aim to be a high order of art. Yet since the one
is shorter and more condensed, it follows that the dramaturgy of the one
is somewhat different from that of the other, just as the technic of the
cameo is different from the technic of the full-sized statue. The
one-act play must, as it were, be presented at a "single setting": it
must start quickly at the beginning with certain definite dramatic
elements and pass rapidly and effectively to a crucial movement without
halt or digression. A careful analysis of any one of the plays in this
volume, like Anton Tchekov's <i>The Boor</i>, or like Oscar M. Wolff's <i>Where
But in America</i>, will reveal this fact. The shorter form of drama, like
the short story, has a technical method characteristically its own.</p>

<p>It is a truth that the one-act play is well made or it is nothing at
all. A careful analysis of Sir James M. Barrie's <i>The Twelve-Pound
Look</i>, Paul Hervieu's <i>Modesty</i>, Althea Thurston's <i>The Exchange</i>, will
reveal that these representative one-act plays are well made and are
real bits of dramatic art. A good one-act play is not a mere cheap
mechanical <i>tour de force</i>; mechanics and artistry it has, of course,
but it is also a high order of art product. A delicately finished cameo
is quite as much a work of art as is the larger statue; both have
mechanics and design in their structure, but those of the cameo are more
deft and more highly specialized than those of the statue, because the
work of the former is done under far more restricted conditions. The
one-act play at its best is cunningly wrought.</p>

<p>Naturally, the material of the one-act play is a bit episodical. It
deals with but a single situation. A study of the plays in this volume
will reveal that no whole life's story can be treated adequately in the
short play, and that no complexity of plot can be employed. Unlike the
longer play, the shorter form of drama shows not the whole man&mdash;except
by passing hint&mdash;but a significant moment or experience, a significant
character-trait. However vividly this chosen moment may be
interpreted&mdash;and<a name="page_005" id="page_005"></a> the one-act play must be vivid&mdash;much will still be
left to the imagination. It is the aim of the one-act form to trace the
causal relations of but <i>one</i> circumstance so that the circumstance may
be intensified. The writer of the one-act play deliberately isolates so
that he may throw the strong flashlight more searchingly on some one
significant event, on some fundamental element of character, on some
moving emotion. He presents in a vigorous, compressed, and suggestive
way a simplification and idealization of a particular part or aspect of
life. Often he opens but a momentary little vista of life, but it is so
clear-cut and so significant that a whole life is often revealed
thereby.</p>

<p>The student must not think that because the one-act play deals with but
one crisis or but one simplified situation, it is therefore weak and
inconsequential. On the contrary, since only one event or situation can
be emphasized, it follows that the writer is obliged to choose the one
determining crisis which makes or mars the supreme struggle of a soul,
the one great change or turning-point or end of a life history. Often
such moments are the really vital material for drama; nothing affords so
much opportunity for striking analysis, for emotional stress, for the
suggestion of a whole character sketched in the act of meeting its test.</p>

<p>The one-act play is a vital literary product. To segregate a bit of
significant experience and to present a finished picture of its aspects
and effects; to dissect a motive so searchingly and skilfully that its
very roots are laid bare; to detach a single figure from a dramatic
sequence and portray the essence of its character; to bring a series of
actions into the clear light of day in a sudden and brief human crisis;
to tell a significant story briefly and with suggestion; to portray the
humor of a person or an incident, or in a trice to reveal the touch of
tragedy resting like the finger of fate on an experience or on a
character&mdash;these are some of the possibilities of the one-act play when
bandied by a master dramatist.<a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a></p>

<h3>THE PROPER APPROACH TO THE STUDY OF THE ONE-ACT PLAY</h3>

<p>To read a one-act play merely to get its story is not in itself an
exercise of any extraordinary value. This sort of approach to any form
of literature does not require much appreciation of literary art nor
much intelligence. Almost any normal-minded person can read a play for
its story with but little expenditure of mental effort. Proper
appreciation of a one-act play requires more than a casual reading whose
chief aim is no more than getting the plot.</p>

<p>If the shorter form of drama is to be appreciated properly as a real
literary form, it must be approached from the point of view of its
artistry and technic. This means that the student should understand its
organic construction and technic, just as he should understand the
organic construction and technic of a short story, a ballad, or a
perfect sonnet, if he is to appreciate them properly.</p>

<p>The student should know <i>what</i> the dramatist intends to get across the
footlights to his audience, and should be able to detect <i>how</i> he
accomplishes the desired result.</p>

<p>It must not be thought that the author urges a study of construction at
the expense of the human values in a play. On the contrary, such a study
is but the means whereby the human values are made the more manifest.
Surely no one would argue that the less one knows about the technic of
music the better able is one to appreciate music. Indeed, it is not too
much to say that, within reasonable limits, no one can really appreciate
a one-act play if one does not know at least the fundamentals of its
dramatic organization.</p>

<p>In fact, students of the one-act play recognize in its constructive
regularity not a hindrance to its beauty but a genuine power. This but
lends to it the charm of perfection. The sonnet and the cameo are
admirable, if for no other reason than their superior<a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a> workmanship. The
one-act play does not lose by any reason of its technical requirements;
indeed, this is one of its greatest assets. And the student who will
take the pains to familiarize himself with the organic construction of a
typical one-act play will have gone a long way in arriving at a proper
appreciation of this shorter form of drama.</p>

<h3>DRAMATIC ANALYSIS AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE ONE-ACT PLAY</h3>

<h4>I. <span class="smcap">The Theme of the One-Act Play</span></h4>

<p>The one-act play, like the short story, is a work of literary art, and
must be approached as such. Just like a painting or a poem or a fine
public building, the one-act play aims at making a <i>singleness of
effect</i> upon the reader or observer. One does not judge a statue, or a
poem, or any other work of art, by the appearance of any isolated part
of it, but by the sum-total effect of the whole. The fundamental aim of
a one-act play is that it shall so present a singleness of effect to the
reader or to the assembled group who have gathered to witness a
performance of it, that the reader or observer will be provoked to
emotional response thereto.</p>

<p>Thus, when a student reads a play like George Middleton's <i>Tradition</i>,
he is made to see and feel that the life of a daughter has been
handicapped and the longings of a mother smothered because of the
conventional narrowness of an otherwise loving father. This is the
singleness of effect of the play; this is its theme. This is precisely
what the author of the play wished his reader or observer to see and
feel. When one reads Bosworth Crocker's <i>The Last Straw</i>, one feels that
a reasonably good and worthy man, because of his sensitiveness to
criticism, has been driven to despair and to a tragic end by the
malicious gossip of neighbors. One's sense of pity at his misfortune is
aroused. This is what the author intended to do. This idea and effect is
the theme of the play. And when the student reads Paul Hervieu's<a name="page_008" id="page_008"></a>
<i>Modesty</i>, he feels that a woman, even though she may lead herself into
thinking she prefers brutal frankness, instinctively likes affection and
even flattery. This is the effect produced by the play; this is its
intent; this is its theme.</p>

<p>In approaching a one-act play, then, the very first consideration should
be to determine what the purpose and intent of the play is&mdash;to determine
its theme. This demands that the play be read through complete at one
sitting and that no premature conclusions be drawn. Once the play is
read, it is well to subject the play to certain leading questions. What
has the author intended that his reader or hearer shall understand,
think, or feel? What is the play about? What is its object and purpose?
Is it a precept or an observation found in life, or is it a bit of
fancy? Is it artificially didactic and moralizing? With what fundamental
element in human nature does it have to do: Love? Patriotism? Fear?
Egotism and self-centredness? Sacrifice? Faithfulness? Or what?</p>

<p>A word of warning should be given. The student should not get the idea
that by theme is meant the moral of the play. A good play may be
thoroughly moral without its descending to commonplace moralizing. Good
plays concern themselves with the presentation of the fundamentals of
life rather than a creed of morals, theories, and propagandas. Art
concerns itself with larger things than didactic and argumentative
moralizing.</p>

<h4>II. <span class="smcap">The Technic of the One-Act Play</span></h4>

<p>Once the student satisfies himself as to the singleness of effect or
theme of the play, he will do well to set himself to the task of seeing
just how the dramatist has achieved this effect. He should keep in mind
that the playwright is a skilled workman; that he has predetermined for
himself just what he wishes his audience to think, feel, or understand,
and has marshalled all his materials to that end. The way by which he
accomplishes that end is his technic. Technic is but the practical
method by<a name="page_009" id="page_009"></a> which an artist can most effectively convey his message to
his public. In a play the materials that the dramatist uses to this end
are character, plot, dialogue, and stage direction. If he is skilled he
will use these elements in such a way that the result will be an
artistic whole, a singleness of effect, an organized unit that will
exemplify and express his theme.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> <span class="smcap">The Characters in the One-Act Play.</span>&mdash;Generally speaking, drama
grows out of character. Farce, melodrama, and extravaganza usually
consist of situation rather than of character. In any event, the student
should avail himself of every means to understand the characters in the
play under discussion. His real appreciation of the play will be in
direct ratio almost to his understanding of the persons in the drama.
Any attention given to this end will be energy well spent. The student
should get into the very heart of the characters, as it were.</p>

<p>Thus, <span class="smcap">Adonijah</span>, in Beulah Bornstead's <i>The Diabolical Circle</i>, is a
narrow, self-centred, Puritan egotist who has little about his
personality to appeal to the romantic and vivacious <span class="smcap">Betty</span>. <span class="smcap">Lady Sims</span>, in
Sir James M. Barrie's <i>The Twelve-Pound Look</i>, is a woman who really is
pathetic in her longing for some human independence in the presence of
her self-centred husband, <span class="smcap">"Sir" Harry Sims</span>. And <span class="smcap">Manikin</span> and <span class="smcap">Minikin</span>, in
Alfred Kreymborg's <i>Manikin and Minikin</i>, are conventionalized puppets
representing the light yet half-serious bickerings, jealousies, and
quarrellings of human nature.</p>

<p>The student will do well to characterize the <i>dramatis personæ</i>
deliberately and specifically. He should not now value himself for
working fast; for things done in a hurry usually lack depth. He must not
be content with vague and thin generalities. In analyzing a character it
might be well to apply some specific questions similar to the following:
Just what is the elemental human quality in the character? Loving?
Trusting? Egotistic? Superstitious? Revengeful? Treacherous? Selfish?
Discontented? Optimistic? Romantic? Or what? How does the<a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a> dramatist
characterize them: By action? By dialogue? By spirit of likes and
dislikes? By racial trait? By religion? By peculiarity of manner,
speech, appearance? Are the characters really dramatic: are they
impelled to strong emotional reaction upon each other and upon
situation? Do they provoke one's dramatic sympathy? Do they make one
feel their own point of view and their own motives for conduct?</p>

<p><i>B.</i> <span class="smcap">The Plot of the One-Act Play.</span>&mdash;Plot and character are integrally
interlinked. Plot is not merely story taken from every-day life, where
seldom do events occur in a series of closely following minor crucial
moments leading to a climax. The dramatist so constructs his material
that there is a sequential and causal interplay of dramatic forces,
ending in some major crisis or crucial moment. Plot may be said to be
the framework and constructed story by which a dramatist exemplifies his
theme. It does not exist for its own end, but is one of the fundamental
means whereby the playwright gets his singleness of effect, or theme, to
his reader or hearer. From the story material at his disposal the
playwright constructs his plot to this very end.</p>

<p>Careful attention should be given to the plot. The student should
question it carefully. Do the plot materials seem to have been taken
from actual life? Or do they seem to be invented? Is the plot well
suited to exemplifying the theme? Reconstruct the story out of which the
plot may have been built. Since the plot of a one-act play is highly
simplified, determine whether there are any complexities, any
irrelevancies, any digressions. Does the plot have a well-defined
beginning, middle, and end?</p>

<p>1. <i>The Beginning of the One-Act Play.</i>&mdash;Having but a relatively short
time at its disposal, usually about thirty minutes and seldom more than
forty-five minutes, the beginning of a one-act play is very short. It is
characterized by condensation, compactness, and brevity. Seldom is the
beginning more than a half-page in length; often the play is got under
way in two or<a name="page_011" id="page_011"></a> three speeches. The student will do well to practise to
the end that he will recognize instantly when the dramatic background of
a one-act play has been laid.</p>

<p>Whatever else may characterize the beginning, it must be dramatically
effective. Instantly it must catch the powers of perception by making
them aware of the initial situation out of which the subsequent dramatic
action will develop. A good beginning makes one <i>feel</i> that suddenly he
has come face to face with a situation which cannot be solved without an
interplay of dramatic forces to a given final result.</p>

<p>Thus, when one reads Althea Thurston's <i>The Exchange</i>, one is made
suddenly to feel that human beings are discontent with their
shortcomings and possessed qualities, and that they always feel that
they would be happier if they possessed something other than what they
have. The <span class="smcap">Judge</span>, who handles the cases as they come in for exchange, is
disgusted with the vanities of humankind, and is ready to clear his
hands of the whole matter. Here is a situation; it is the beginning of
the play. In the beginning of Lady Gregory's <i>Hyacinth Halvey</i> one is
brought suddenly to the realization that <span class="smcap">Hyacinth Halvey</span> instinctively
rebels against the highly colored and artificially created good name
that has been unwittingly superimposed upon him. This situation,
suddenly presented, is the beginning of the play. Out of this initial
situation the subsequent dramatic action evolves.</p>

<p>Is the beginning too short? Too long? Does it make the initial dramatic
situation clear? How has the playwright made it clear and effective?
Just where is the end of the beginning? Although the beginning and the
subsequent plot development are well blended together, so that there is
no halting where the beginning ends, usually one can detect where the
one ends and the other begins. It is a good idea, for the purpose of
developing a sense of the organic structure of the one-act play, to draw
a line across the page of the play, just where the one ends and the
other begins.<a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a></p>

<p>The <i>setting</i> of the play is a part of the beginning. Is the setting
realistic? Romantic? Fantastic or bizarre? Are the details of stage
design, properties, and especially the atmosphere and color scheme in
harmony with the tone of the play itself? Is the setting really an
organic part of the play or is it something apart from it? Note that the
setting is usually written in the third person, present tense, and in
italics.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Middle of the One-Act Play.</i>&mdash;The middle of a one-act play is
concerned primarily with the main crucial moment or climax and the
dramatic movement that from the beginning leads up to it. A good play
consists of a series of minor crises leading up to a major crisis or
crucial moment. It is for this crucial moment that the play exists; it
is for this big scene precisely that the play has been written. Indeed,
the play succeeds or fails as the crucial moment is strongly dramatic or
flabbily weak. This is the part of the play that is strongest in
dramatic tension, strongest in emotional functioning.</p>

<p>A study of Sir James M. Barrie's <i>The Twelve-Pound Look</i> shows that the
crucial moment comes at the point where <span class="smcap">"Sir" Harry Sims</span> in his
self-centred egotism discovers that his wife's, <span class="smcap">Lady Sims's</span>,
heart-longing could easily be satisfied if she were permitted no other
freedom than merely operating a typewriter. In Althea Thurston's <i>The
Exchange</i> the crucial moment comes when the several characters, who
unwittingly had exchanged one ill for a worse one, find that they can
never re-exchange, and that they must endure the torments and
displeasure of the newly acquired ill throughout life.</p>

<p>Just where is the crucial moment or climax in the play under
consideration? Determine the several minor crises that lead up to the
crucial moment. Is the crucial moment delayed too long for good dramatic
effect? Or is it reached too soon, so that the play is too short and too
sudden in reaching the climax? Does it make one <i>feel</i> that some vital
result has been attained in the plot movement? Is it characterized by
strong situation and by<a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a> strong emotional reactions of character on
character or of character on situation?</p>

<p>For purposes of impressing a sense the organic structure of a one-act
play, it is a good plan to draw a horizontal line across the page at the
close of the crucial moment. Keep in mind, however, that the crucial
moment is <i>not</i> the end of the play as it appears on the printed page or
as it is acted on the stage.</p>

<p>3. <i>The End of the One-Act Play.</i>&mdash;The end of the one-act play is an
important consideration. Too often it is entirely lost sight of. It is
the part that frequently makes or mars a play. When the crucial moment
or climax has been reached, the plot action of the play is completed,
but the play is not yet completed. The play needs yet to be rounded out
into an artistic and dramatic whole. In life the actual crisis in human
affairs is not often our chiefest interest, but the reaction of
characters immediately <i>after</i> the crisis has occurred. Thus, in a play,
the emotional reaction of the characters on the crucial moment and the
more or less sudden readjustment between characters after the crucial
moment must be presented. For this very purpose the end of the one-act
play is constructed. The end is of need very short&mdash;usually even shorter
than the beginning. Usually the end consists of but a speech or two, or
sometimes only of pantomime that more effectively expresses the
emotional reactions of the characters on the crucial moment than
dialogue.</p>

<p>Thus, in Sir James M. Barrie's <i>The Twelve-Pound Look</i>, the end consists
of but pantomime, in which <span class="smcap">"Sir" Harry</span> expresses his emotional reaction
upon his wife's longing for the human liberty that even the operating of
a typewriter would provide her. The end of Bosworth Crocker's <i>The Last
Straw</i> comes immediately after the pistol-shot is heard in the adjoining
room and <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bauer's</span> voice is heard: "Fritz! Fritz! Speak to me! Look
at me, Fritz! You didn't do it, Fritz! I know you didn't do it!" etc.</p>

<p>Is the end of the play under consideration in terms of dialogue?<a name="page_014" id="page_014"></a> In
pantomime? Or both? Is it too long? Too short? Is it dramatic? Is it
conclusive and satisfying?</p>

<p><i>C.</i> <span class="smcap">Dialogue of the One-Act Play.</span>&mdash;Dialogue, like plot and
characterization, is another means whereby the theme of the play is got
to the reader or audience. Good dramatic dialogue is constructed to this
very end. It is not the commonplace, rambling, uncertain, and realistic
question and answer of every-day life. Usually good dramatic dialogue is
crisp, direct, condensed. It is the substance but not the form of
ordinary conversation. Its chiefest characteristic is spontaneity.</p>

<p><i>The highest type of dramatic dialogue is that which expresses the ideas
and emotions of characters at the points of highest emotional
functioning.</i> It will readily be seen, then, that not all dialogue in a
play is necessarily dramatic. In truth, the best dramatic dialogue
occurs in conjunction with the series of minor crises and the crucial
moment that go to make up the dramatic movement of the play. Often there
is much dialogue in a play that essentially is not dramatic at all.</p>

<p>In analyzing dramatic dialogue it is well to inquire whether in the play
it serves (1) to express the ideas and emotions of characters at points
of highest emotional functioning, (2) to advance the plot, (3) to reveal
character, or (4) what. Is it brief, clear, direct, spontaneous? Or is
it careless, loose, insipid? Wit, repartee? Didactic, moralizing?
Satirical, cynical?</p>

<p><i>D.</i> <span class="smcap">Stage-Business and Stage-Direction in the One-Act Play.</span>&mdash;The
stage-business and stage-direction, usually printed in italics, of a
play are an essential part of a drama. They must not be ignored in
either reading or staging a play. The novel or short story generally
uses narration and description to achieve its desired result; a play, on
the contrary, uses dialogue and concrete objective pantomime that may be
seen readily with the eye. A play is not a story narrated in
chronological order of events, but it is a story so handled and so
constructed that it can be acted on a stage by actors before an
audience. It is a series<a name="page_015" id="page_015"></a> of minor crises leading to a major crisis,
presented to a reader or to an audience by characters, dialogue, and
stage-business and pantomime. For purposes of indicating the pantomimic
action of the play, the dramatist resorts to stage-business and
stage-direction.</p>

<p>Does the stage-direction aid in making (1) the dialogue, (2) the plot,
(3) the dramatic action, or (4) the character more clear? Does it
shorten the play? Does it express idea, emotion, or situations more
effectively than could dialogue, if it were used?</p>

<p>And, finally, do not judge any play until all the evidence is in, until
you have thoroughly mastered every detail and have fully conceived the
<i>author's idea</i> and <i>purpose</i>. It is not a question whether <i>you</i> would
have selected such a theme or whether <i>you</i> would have handled it in the
same way in which the author did; but the point is does the <i>author</i> in
<i>his</i> way make <i>his</i> theme clear to you. The author has conceived a
dramatic problem in his <i>own mind</i> and has set it forth in <i>his own
way</i>. The question is, does he make you see his result and his method?</p>

<p>Do you like the play? Or do you not like it? State your reason in either
case. Is it because of the author? Is it because of the theme? Is it
because of the technic&mdash;the way he gets his intent to his reader or
audience? Is it because of your own likes or dislikes; preconceived
notions or prejudices? Is it because of the acting? Of the staging or
setting? Does it uplift or depress? Does it provoke you to emotional
functioning?</p>

<h2>
THE TWELVE-POUND LOOK<br />
<br />
<small>BY<br />
<br />
SIR JAMES M. BARRIE</small></h2>

<div class="copyr">
<p><i>The Twelve-Pound Look</i> is reprinted by permission of Charles Scribner's
Sons, the publisher in America of the works of Sir James M. Barrie. For

<p>Sir James M. Barrie is rated as the foremost English dramatist of the
day; and his plays, taken together, make the most significant
contribution to English drama since Sheridan. Practically his entire
life has been given to the writing of novels and plays, many of the
latter having their heroines conceived especially for Maude Adams, one
of America's greatest actresses. He was born in Kirriemuir, Scotland, in
1860. He received his education at Dumfries and Edinburgh University.
His first work in journalism and letters was done at Nottingham, but
soon he took up his work in London, where he now resides.</p>

<p>Sir James M. Barrie's literary labors have been very fruitful. His <i>The
Professor's Love Story</i>, <i>The Little Minister</i>, <i>Quality Street</i>, <i>The
Admirable Crichton</i>, <i>Peter Pan</i>, <i>What Every Woman Knows</i>, and <i>Alice
Sit-by-the-Fire</i> are well known to every one.</p>

<p>In 1914 there appeared a volume of one-act plays, <i>Half Hours</i>, the most
important of which is <i>The Twelve-Pound Look</i>. And in 1918 appeared a
volume, <i>Echoes of the War</i>, the most important one-act play therein
being <i>The Old Lady Shows Her Medals</i>.</p>

<p>Barrie is a great playwright because he is so thoroughly human. All the
little whimsicalities, sentiments, little loves, and heart-longings of
human beings are ever present in his plays. He is no reformer, no
propagandist. He appeals to the emotions rather than to the intellect.
He continues the romantic tradition in English drama and gives us plays
that are wholesome, tender, and human. And with all this, he has the
added saving grace of a most absorbing humor.</p>

<p>While Barrie is not a devotee of the well-made play, his <i>The
Twelve-Pound Look</i> is one of the most nearly perfect one-act plays of
contemporary drama. His interest in human personalities is not more
manifest in any of his plays than in <span class="smcap">Lady Sims</span> and <span class="smcap">"Sir" Harry Sims</span> in
this play.<a name="page_020" id="page_020"></a></p>

<p class="hang"><i>If quite convenient (as they say about checks) you are to conceive
that the scene is laid in your own house, and that</i> <span class="smcap">Harry Sims</span> <i>is
you. Perhaps the ornamentation of the house is a trifle
ostentatious, but if you cavil at that we are willing to
redecorate: you don't get out of being</i> <span class="smcap">Harry Sims</span> <i>on a mere
matter of plush and dados. It pleases us to make him a city man,
but (rather than lose you) he can be turned with a scrape of the
pen into a K.C., fashionable doctor, Secretary of State, or what

neck, but we shall waive that point if you know him to be thin.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>It is that day in your career when everything went wrong just when

<p class="hang"><i>In</i> <span class="smcap">Harry's</span> <i>case it was a woman who did the mischief. She came to
him in his great hour and told him she did not admire him. Of
course he turned her out of the house and was soon himself again,
but it spoiled the morning for him. This is the subject of the
play, and quite enough too.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Harry</span> <i>is to receive the honor of knighthood in a few days, and we
discover him in the sumptuous "snuggery" of his home in Kensington

Sims</span> <i>(as we may call her for the last time, as it were, and
strictly as a good-natured joke) is wearing her presentation gown,
and personates the august one who is about to dub her</i> <span class="smcap">Harry</span>
<i>knight. She is seated regally. Her jewelled shoulders proclaim
aloud her husband's generosity. She must<a name="page_022" id="page_022"></a> be an extraordinarily
proud and happy woman, yet she has a drawn face and shrinking ways,
as if there were some one near her of whom she is afraid. She claps
her hands, as the signal to</i> <span class="smcap">Harry</span>. <i>He enters bowing, and with a
graceful swerve of the leg. He is only partly in costume, the sword
and the real stockings not having arrived yet. With a gliding
motion that is only delayed while one leg makes up on the other, he
reaches his wife, and, going on one knee, raises her hand superbly
to his lips. She taps him on the shoulder with a paper-knife and
says huskily: "Rise, Sir Harry." He rises, bows, and glides about
the room, going on his knees to various articles of furniture, and
rises from each a knight. It is a radiant domestic scene, and</i>
<span class="smcap">Harry</span> <i>is as dignified as if he knew that royalty was rehearsing it
at the other end</i>.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Complacently.</i>] Did that seem all right, eh?</p>

<p>L<small>ADY</small> S<small>IMS</small>. [<i>Much relieved.</i>] I think perfect.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. But was it dignified?</p>

<p>L<small>ADY</small> S<small>IMS</small>. Oh, very. And it will be still more so when you have the
sword.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. The sword will lend it an air. There are really the five
moments&mdash;[<i>suiting the action to the word</i>]&mdash;the glide&mdash;the dip&mdash;the
kiss&mdash;the tap&mdash;and you back out a knight. It's short, but it's a very
beautiful ceremony. [<i>Kindly.</i>] Anything you can suggest?</p>

<p>L<small>ADY</small> S<small>IMS</small>. No&mdash;oh, no. [<i>Nervously, seeing him pause to kiss the tassel
of a cushion.</i>] You don't think you have practised till you know what to
do almost too well?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He has been in a blissful temper, but such niggling criticism
would try any man.</i></p></div>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. I do not. Don't talk nonsense. Wait till your opinion is
asked for.</p>

<p>L<small>ADY</small> S<small>IMS</small>. [<i>Abashed.</i>] I'm sorry, Harry. [<i>A perfect butler appears and
presents a card.</i>] "The Flora Typewriting Agency."<a name="page_023" id="page_023"></a></p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. Ah, yes. I telephoned them to send some one. A woman, I
suppose, Tombes?</p>

<p>T<small>OMBES</small>. Yes, Sir Harry.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. Show her in here. [<i>He has very lately become a stickler for
etiquette.</i>] And, Tombes, strictly speaking, you know, I am not Sir
Harry till Thursday.</p>

<p>T<small>OMBES</small>. Beg pardon, sir, but it is such a satisfaction to us.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Good-naturedly.</i>] Ah, they like it down-stairs, do they?</p>

<p>T<small>OMBES</small>. [<i>Unbending.</i>] Especially the females, Sir Harry.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. Exactly. You can show her in, Tombes. [<i>The butler departs on
his mighty task.</i>] You can tell the woman what she is wanted for, Emmy,
while I change. [<i>He is too modest to boast about himself, and prefers
to keep a wife in the house for that purpose.</i>] You can tell her the
sort of things about me that will come better from you. [<i>Smiling
happily.</i>] You heard what Tombes said: "Especially the females." And he
is right. Success! The women like it even better than the men. And
rightly. For they share. <i>You</i> share, <i>Lady</i> Sims. Not a woman will see
that gown without being sick with envy of it. I know them. Have all our
lady friends in to see it. It will make them ill for a week.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>These sentiments carry him off light-heartedly, and presently the
disturbing element is shown in. She is a mere typist, dressed in
uncommonly good taste, but at contemptibly small expense, and she
is carrying her typewriter in a friendly way rather than as a badge
of slavery, as of course it is. Her eye is clear; and in odd
contrast to</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Sims</span>, <i>she is self-reliant and serene</i>.</p></div>

morning, madam.</p>

<p>L<small>ADY</small> S<small>IMS</small>. [<i>In her nervous way, and scarcely noticing that the typist
is a little too ready with her tongue.</i>] Good morning. [<i>As a first
impression she rather likes the woman, and the woman,<a name="page_024" id="page_024"></a> though it is
scarcely worth mentioning, rather likes her.</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Sims</span> <i>has a maid for
buttoning and unbuttoning her, and probably another for waiting on the
maid, and she gazes with a little envy perhaps at a woman who does
things for herself</i>.] Is that the typewriting machine?</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Who is getting it ready for use.</i>] Yes. [<i>Not "Yes, madam" as it
ought to be.</i>] I suppose if I am to work here I may take this off. I get
on better without it. [<i>She is referring to her hat.</i></p>

<p>L<small>ADY</small> S<small>IMS</small>. Certainly. [<i>But the hat is already off.</i>] I ought to
apologize for my gown. I am to be presented this week, and I was trying
it on.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Her tone is not really apologetic. She is rather clinging to the
glory of her gown, wistfully, as if not absolutely certain, you
know, that it is a glory.</i></p></div>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. It is beautiful, if I may presume to say so.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She frankly admires it. She probably has a best and a second best

beautiful. [<i>The beauty of it gives her courage.</i>] Sit down, please.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>The sort of woman who would have sat down in any case.</i>] I

<p>L<small>ADY</small> S<small>IMS</small>. [<i>Almost with the humility of a servant.</i>] Oh, it is not work
for me, it is for my husband, and what he needs is not exactly copying.
[<i>Swelling, for she is proud of</i> <span class="smcap">Harry</span>.] He wants a number of letters
answered&mdash;hundreds of them&mdash;letters and telegrams of congratulation.</p>

<p>L<small>ADY</small> S<small>IMS</small>. What have you got?</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Reading.</i>] "Indeed, I would have asked to be allowed to decline
had it not been that I want to please my wife."</p>

<p>L<small>ADY</small> S<small>IMS</small>. [<i>Heavily.</i>] But how could you know it was that?</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Is it?</p>

<p>L<small>ADY</small> S<small>IMS</small>. [<i>Who, after all, is the one with the right to ask
questions.</i>] Do they all accept it for that reason?</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. That is what we are told to say in the letters.</p>

<p>L<small>ADY</small> S<small>IMS</small>. [<i>Thoughtlessly.</i>] It is quite as if you knew my husband.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. I assure you, I don't even know his name.</p>

<p>L<small>ADY</small> S<small>IMS</small>. [<i>Suddenly showing that she knows him.</i>] Oh, he wouldn't like
that!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>And it is here that</i> <span class="smcap">Harry</span> <i>re-enters in his city garments,

the annoying</i> <span class="smcap">Katherine</span> <i>is to get a shock also</i>.</p></div>

<p>L<small>ADY</small> S<small>IMS</small>. This is the lady, Harry.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Shooting his cuffs.</i>] Yes, yes. Good morning, my dear.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Then they see each other, and their mouths open, but not for

<p>L<small>ADY</small> S<small>IMS</small>. [<i>Who has seen nothing.</i>] I have been trying to explain to
her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. Eh&mdash;what? [<i>He controls himself.</i>] Leave it to me, Emmy; I'll
attend to her.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Lady Sims</span> <i>goes, with a dread fear that somehow she has vexed her

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>With concentrated scorn.</i>] You!</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>As if agreeing with him.</i>] Yes, it's funny.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. The shamelessness of your daring to come here.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Believe me, it is not less a surprise to me than it is to you. I
was sent here in the ordinary way of business. I was given only the
number of the house. I was not told the name.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Withering her.</i>] The ordinary way of business! This is what
you have fallen to&mdash;a typist!</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Unwithered.</i>] Think of it!</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. After going through worse straits, I'll be bound.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>With some grim memories.</i>] Much worse straits.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Alas, laughing coarsely.</i>] My congratulations!</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Thank you, Harry.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Who is annoyed, as any man would be, not to find her
abject.</i>] Eh? What was that you called me, madam?</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Isn't it Harry? On my soul, I almost forget.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. It isn't Harry to you. My name is Sims, if you please.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Yes, I had not forgotten that. It was my name, too, you see.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>In his best manner.</i>] It was your name till you forfeited
the right to bear it.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Exactly.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Gloating.</i>] I was furious to find you here, but on second
thoughts it pleases me. [<i>From the depths of his moral nature.</i>] There
is a grim justice in this.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Sympathetically.</i>] Tell me?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. Do you know what you were brought here to do?</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. I have just been learning. You have been made a knight, and I was
summoned to answer the messages of congratulation.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. That's it, that's it. You come on this day as my servant!</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. I, who might have been Lady Sims.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. And you are her typist instead. And she has<a name="page_028" id="page_028"></a> four
men-servants. Oh, I am glad you saw her in her presentation gown.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. I wonder if she would let me do her washing, Sir Harry?</p>

<p class="r">[<i>Her want
of taste disgusts him.</i></p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>With dignity.</i>] You can go. The mere thought that only a

children&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He will never know why a new light has come into her face.</i></p></div>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Slowly.</i>] You have children?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Inflated.</i>] Two. [<i>He wonders why she is so long in
answering.</i></p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Resorting to impertinence.</i>] Such a nice number.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>With an extra turn of the screw.</i>] Both boys.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Successful in everything. Are they like you, Sir Harry?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Expanding.</i>] They are very like me.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. That's nice. [<i>Even on such a subject as this she can be ribald.</i></p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. Will you please to go.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Heigho! What shall I say to my employer?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. That is no affair of mine.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. What will you say to Lady Sims?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. I flatter myself that whatever I say, Lady Sims will accept
without comment.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She smiles, heaven knows why, unless her next remark explains
it.</i></p></div>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Still the same Harry.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. What do you mean?</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Only that you have the old confidence in your profound knowledge
of the sex.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Beginning to think as little of her intellect as of her
morals.</i>] I suppose I know my wife.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Hopelessly dense.</i>] I suppose so. I was only remembering<a name="page_029" id="page_029"></a> that
you used to think you knew her in the days when I was the lady. [<i>He is
merely wasting his time on her, and he indicates the door. She is not
sufficiently the lady to retire worsted.</i>] Well, good-by, Sir Harry.
Won't you ring, and the four men-servants will show me out?</p>

<p class="r"> [<i>But he
hesitates.</i></p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>In spite of himself.</i>] As you are here, there is something
I want to get out of you. [<i>Wishing he could ask it less eagerly.</i>] Tell
me, who was the man?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The strange woman&mdash;it is evident now that she has always been
strange to him&mdash;smiles tolerantly.</i></p></div>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. You never found out?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. I could never be sure.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Reflectively.</i>] I thought that would worry you.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Sneering.</i>] It's plain that he soon left you.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Very soon.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. As I could have told you. [<i>But still she surveys him with
the smile of Mona Lisa. The badgered man has to entreat.</i>] Who was he?
It was fourteen years ago, and cannot matter to any of us now. Kate,
tell me who he was?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>It is his first youthful moment, and perhaps because of that she
does not wish to hurt him.</i></p></div>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Shaking a motherly head.</i>] Better not ask.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. I do ask. Tell me.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. It is kinder not to tell you.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Violently.</i>] Then, by James, it was one of my own pals. Was
it Bernard Roche? [<i>She shakes her head.</i>] It may have been some one who
comes to my house still.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. I think not. [<i>Reflecting.</i>] Fourteen years! You found my letter
that night when you went home?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Impatient.</i>] Yes.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. I propped it against the decanters. I thought you would be sure to
see it there. It was a room not unlike this, and the furniture was
arranged in the same attractive way. How it all comes back to me. Don't
you see me, Harry, in hat and<a name="page_030" id="page_030"></a> cloak, putting the letter there, taking a
last look round, and then stealing out into the night to meet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. Whom?</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Him. Hours pass, no sound in the room but the tick-tack of the
clock, and then about midnight you return alone. You take&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Gruffly.</i>] I wasn't alone.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>The picture spoiled.</i>] No? Oh. [<i>Plaintively.</i>] Here have I all
these years been conceiving it wrongly. [<i>She studies his face.</i>] I
believe something interesting happened.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Growling.</i>] Something confoundedly annoying.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Coaxing.</i>] Do tell me.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. We won't go into that. Who was the man? Surely a husband has
a right to know with whom his wife bolted.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Who is detestably ready with her tongue.</i>] Surely the wife has a
right to know how he took it. [<i>The woman's love of bargaining comes to
her aid.</i>] A fair exchange. You tell me what happened, and I will tell
you who he was.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. You will? Very well.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>It is the first point on which they have agreed, and, forgetting
himself, he takes a place beside her on the fire-seat. He is
thinking only of what he is to tell her, but she, womanlike, is
conscious of their proximity.</i></p></div>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Tastelessly.</i>] Quite like old times. [<i>He moves away from her
indignantly.</i>] Go on, Harry.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Who has a manful shrinking from saying anything that is to
his disadvantage.</i>] Well, as you know, I was dining at the club that
night.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Yes.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. Jack Lamb drove me home. Mabbett Green was with us, and I
asked them to come in for a few minutes.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Jack Lamb, Mabbett Green? I think I remember them. Jack was in
Parliament.<a name="page_031" id="page_031"></a></p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. No, that was Mabbett. They came into the house with me
and&mdash;[<i>with sudden horror</i>]&mdash;was it him?</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Bewildered.</i>] Who?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. Mabbett?</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. What?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. The man?</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. What man? [<i>Understanding.</i>] Oh, no. I thought you said he came
into the house with you.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. It might have been a blind.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Well, it wasn't. Go on.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. They came in to finish a talk we had been having at the club.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. An interesting talk, evidently.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. The papers had been full that evening of the elopement of
some countess woman with a fiddler. What was her name?</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Does it matter?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. No. [<i>Thus ends the countess.</i>] We had been discussing the
thing and&mdash;[<i>he pulls a wry face</i>]&mdash;and I had been rather warm&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>With horrid relish.</i>] I begin to see. You had been saying it
served the husband right, that the man who could not look after his wife
deserved to lose her. It was one of your favorite subjects. Oh, Harry,
say it was that!</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Sourly.</i>] It may have been something like that.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. And all the time the letter was there, waiting; and none of you
knew except the clock. Harry, it is sweet of you to tell me. [<i>His face
is not sweet. The illiterate woman has used the wrong adjective.</i>] I
forget what I said precisely in the letter.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Pulverizing her.</i>] So do I. But I have it still.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Not pulverized.</i>] Do let me see it again.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She has observed his eye wandering to the desk.</i></p></div>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. You are welcome to it as a gift.<a name="page_032" id="page_032"></a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The fateful letter, a poor little dead thing, is brought to light
from a locked drawer.</i></p></div>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Taking it.</i>] Yes, this is it. Harry, how you did crumple it!
[<i>She reads, not without curiosity.</i>] "Dear husband&mdash;I call you that for
the last time&mdash;I am off. I am what you call making a bolt of it. I won't
try to excuse myself nor to explain, for you would not accept the
excuses nor understand the explanation. It will be a little shock to
you, but only to your pride; what will astound you is that any woman
could be such a fool as to leave such a man as you. I am taking nothing
with me that belongs to you. May you be very happy.&mdash;Your ungrateful
<span class="smcap">Kate</span>. <i>P.S.</i>&mdash;You need not try to find out who he is. You will try, but
you won't succeed." [<i>She folds the nasty little thing up.</i>] I may
really have it for my very own?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. You really may.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Impudently.</i>] If you would care for a typed copy&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>In a voice with which he used to frighten his
grandmother</i>.] None of your sauce! [<i>Wincing.</i>] I had to let them see it
in the end.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. I can picture Jack Lamb eating it.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. A penniless parson's daughter.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. That is all I was.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. We searched for the two of you high and low.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Private detectives?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. They couldn't get on the track of you.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Smiling.</i>] No?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. But at last the courts let me serve the papers by
advertisement on a man unknown, and I got my freedom.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. So I saw. It was the last I heard of you.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Each word a blow for her.</i>] And I married again just as
soon as ever I could.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. They say that is always a compliment to the first wife.<a name="page_033" id="page_033"></a></p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Violently.</i>] I showed them.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. You soon let them see that if one woman was a fool, you still had
the pick of the basket to choose from.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. By James, I did.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Bringing him to earth again.</i>] But still, you wondered who he
was.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. I suspected everybody&mdash;even my pals. I felt like jumping at
their throats and crying: "It's you!"</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. You had been so admirable to me, an instinct told you that I was
sure to choose another of the same.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. I thought, it can't be money, so it must be looks. Some dolly
face. [<i>He stares at her in perplexity.</i>] He must have had something
wonderful about him to make you willing to give up all that you had with
me.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>As if he was the stupid one.</i>] Poor Harry.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. And it couldn't have been going on for long, for I would have
noticed the change in you.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Would you?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. I knew you so well.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. You amazing man.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. So who was he? Out with it.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. You are determined to know?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. Your promise. You gave your word.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. If I must&mdash;[<i>She is the villain of the piece, but it must be
conceded that in this matter she is reluctant to pain him.</i>] I am sorry
I promised. [<i>Looking at him steadily.</i>] There was no one, Harry; no one
at all.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>.. [<i>Rising.</i>] If you think you can play with me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. I told you that you wouldn't like it.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Rasping.</i>] It is unbelievable.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. I suppose it is; but it is true.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. Your letter itself gives you the lie.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. That was intentional. I saw that if the truth were known you might
have a difficulty in getting your freedom; and<a name="page_034" id="page_034"></a> as I was getting mine it
seemed fair that you should have yours also. So I wrote my good-by in
words that would be taken to mean what you thought they meant, and I
knew the law would back you in your opinion. For the law, like you,
Harry, has a profound understanding of women.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Trying to straighten, himself.</i>] I don't believe you yet.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Looking not unkindly into the soul of this man.</i>] Perhaps that
is the best way to take it. It is less unflattering than the truth. But
you were the only one. [<i>Summing up her life.</i>] You sufficed.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. Then what mad impulse&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. It was no impulse, Harry. I had thought it out for a year.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. A year? [<i>Dazed.</i>] One would think to hear you that I hadn't
been a good husband to you.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>With a sad smile.</i>] You were a good husband according to your
lights.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Stoutly.</i>] <i>I</i> think so.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. And a moral man, and chatty, and quite the philanthropist.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>On sure ground.</i>] All women envied you.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. How you loved me to be envied.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. I swaddled you in luxury.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Making her great revelation.</i>] That was it.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Blankly.</i>] What?</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Who can be serene because it is all over.</i>] How you beamed at me
when I sat at the head of your fat dinners in my fat jewelry, surrounded
by our fat friends.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Aggrieved.</i>] They weren't so fat.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>A side issue.</i>] All except those who were so thin. Have you ever
noticed, Harry, that many jewels make women either incredibly fat or
incredibly thin?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Shouting.</i>] I have not. [<i>Is it worth while to<a name="page_035" id="page_035"></a> argue with
her any longer?</i>] We had all the most interesting society of the day. It
wasn't only business men. There were politicians, painters, writers&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Only the glorious, dazzling successes. Oh, the fat talk while we
ate too much&mdash;about who had made a hit and who was slipping back, and
what the noo house cost and the noo motor and the gold soup-plates, and
who was to be the noo knight.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Who it will be observed is unanswerable from first to
last.</i>] Was anybody getting on better than me, and consequently you?</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Consequently me! Oh, Harry, you and your sublime religion.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Honest heart.</i>] My religion? I never was one to talk about
religion, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Pooh, Harry, you don't even know what your religion was and is and
will be till the day of your expensive funeral. [<i>And here is the lesson
that life has taught her.</i>] One's religion is whatever he is most
interested in, and yours is Success.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Quoting from his morning paper.</i>] Ambition&mdash;it is the last
infirmity of noble minds.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Noble minds!</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>At last grasping what she is talking about.</i>] You are not
saying that you left me because of my success?</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Yes, that was it. [<i>And now she stands revealed to him.</i>] I
couldn't endure it. If a failure had come now and then&mdash;but your success
was suffocating me. [<i>She is rigid with emotion.</i>] The passionate
craving I had to be done with it, to find myself among people who had
not got on.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>With proper spirit.</i>] There are plenty of them.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. There were none in our set. When they began to go down-hill they
rolled out of our sight.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Clenching it.</i>] I tell you I am worth a quarter of a
million.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small> [<i>Unabashed.</i>] That is what you are worth to yourself.<a name="page_036" id="page_036"></a> I'll tell
you what you are worth to me: exactly twelve pounds. For I made up my
mind that I could launch myself on the world alone if I first proved my
mettle by earning twelve pounds; and as soon as I had earned it I left
you.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>In the scales.</i>] Twelve pounds!</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. That is your value to a woman. If she can't make it she has to
stick to you.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Remembering perhaps a rectory garden.</i>] You valued me at
more than that when you married me.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Seeing it also.</i>] Ah, I didn't know you then. If only you had
been a man, Harry.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. A man? What do you mean by a man?</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Leaving the garden.</i>] Haven't you heard of them? They are
something fine; and every woman is loath to admit to herself that her
husband is not one. When she marries, even though she has been a very
trivial person, there is in her some vague stirring toward a worthy
life, as well as a fear of her capacity for evil. She knows her chance
lies in him. If there is something good in him, what is good in her
finds it, and they join forces against the baser parts. So I didn't give
you up willingly, Harry. I invented all sorts of theories to explain
you. Your hardness&mdash;I said it was a fine want of mawkishness. Your
coarseness&mdash;I said it goes with strength. Your contempt for the weak&mdash;I
called it virility. Your want of ideals was clear-sightedness. Your
ignoble views of women&mdash;I tried to think them funny. Oh, I clung to you
to save myself. But I had to let go; you had only the one quality,
Harry, success; you had it so strong that it swallowed all the others.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Not to be diverted from the main issue.</i>] How did you earn
that twelve pounds?</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. It took me nearly six months; but I earned it fairly. [<i>She
presses her hand on the typewriter as lovingly as many a woman has
pressed a rose.</i>] I learned this. I hired it and taught myself. I got
some work through a friend, and with my first twelve<a name="page_037" id="page_037"></a> pounds I paid for
my machine. Then I considered that I was free to go, and I went.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. All this going on in my house while you were living in the
lap of luxury! [<i>She nods.</i>] By God, you were determined.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Briefly.</i>] By God, I was.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Staring.</i>] How you must have hated me.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Smiling at the childish word.</i>] Not a bit&mdash;after I saw that
there was a way out. From that hour you amused me, Harry; I was even
sorry for you, for I saw that you couldn't help yourself. Success is
just a fatal gift.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. Oh, thank you.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Thinking, dear friends in front, of you and me perhaps.</i>] Yes,
and some of your most successful friends knew it. One or two of them
used to look very sad at times, as if they thought they might have come
to something if they hadn't got on.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Who has a horror of sacrilege.</i>] The battered crew you live
among now&mdash;what are they but folk who have tried to succeed and failed?</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. That's it; they try, but they fail.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. And always will fail.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Always. Poor souls&mdash;I say of them. Poor soul&mdash;they say of me. It
keeps us human. That is why I never tire of them.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Comprehensively.</i>] Bah! Kate, I tell you I'll be worth half
a million yet.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. I'm sure you will. You're getting stout, Harry.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. No, I'm not.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. What was the name of that fat old fellow who used to fall asleep
at our dinner-parties?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. If you mean Sir William Crackley&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. That was the man. Sir William was to me a perfect picture of the
grand success. He had got on so well that he was very, very stout, and
when he sat on a chair it was thus [<i>her hands<a name="page_038" id="page_038"></a> meeting in front of
her</i>]&mdash;as if he were holding his success together. That is what you are
working for, Harry. You will have that and the half million about the
same time.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Who has surely been very patient.</i>] Will you please to
leave my house?</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Putting on her gloves, soiled things.</i>] But don't let us part in
anger. How do you think I am looking, Harry, compared to the dull, inert
thing that used to roll round in your padded carriages?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>In masterly fashion.</i>] I forget what you were like. I'm
very sure you never could have held a candle to the present Lady Sims.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. That is a picture of her, is it not?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Seizing his chance again.</i>] In her wedding-gown. Painted by
an R.A.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Wickedly.</i>] A knight?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Deceived.</i>] Yes.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Who likes</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Sims</span>&mdash;<i>a piece of presumption on her part</i>.] It
is a very pretty face.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>With the pride of possession.</i>] Acknowledged to be a beauty
everywhere.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. There is a merry look in the eyes, and character in the chin.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Like an auctioneer.</i>] Noted for her wit.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. All her life before her when that was painted. It is a
<i>spirituelle</i> face too. [<i>Suddenly she turns on him with anger, for the
first and only time in the play.</i>] Oh, Harry, you brute!</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Staggered.</i>] Eh? What?</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. That dear creature, capable of becoming a noble wife and
mother&mdash;she is the spiritless woman of no account that I saw here a few
minutes ago. I forgive you for myself, for I escaped, but that poor lost
soul, oh, Harry, Harry.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Waving her to the door.</i>] I'll thank you&mdash;If<a name="page_039" id="page_039"></a> ever there
was a woman proud of her husband and happy in her married life, that
woman is Lady Sims.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. I wonder.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. Then you needn't wonder.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Slowly.</i>] If I was a husband&mdash;it is my advice to all of them&mdash;I
would often watch my wife quietly to see whether the twelve-pound look
was not coming into her eyes. Two boys, did you say, and both like you?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. What is that to you?</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>With glistening eyes</i>.] I was only thinking that somewhere there
are two little girls who, when they grow up&mdash;the dear, pretty girls who
are all meant for the men that don't get on! Well, good-by, Sir Harry.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Showing a little human weakness, it is to be feared.</i>] Say
first that you're sorry.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. For what?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. That you left me. Say you regret it bitterly. You know you
do. [<i>She smiles and shakes her head. He is pettish. He makes a terrible
announcement.</i>] You have spoiled the day for me.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>To hearten him.</i>] I am sorry for that; but it is only a
pin-prick, Harry. I suppose it is a little jarring in the moment of your
triumph to find that there is&mdash;one old friend&mdash;who does not think you a
success; but you will soon forget it. Who cares what a typist thinks?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Heartened.</i>] Nobody. A typist at eighteen shillings a week!</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>Proudly.</i>] Not a bit of it, Harry. I double that.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Neatly.</i>] Magnificent!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>There is a timid knock at the door.</i>]</p></div>

<p>L<small>ADY</small> S<small>IMS</small>. May I come in?</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Rather appealingly.</i>] It is Lady Sims.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. I won't tell. She is afraid to come into her husband's room
without knocking!<a name="page_040" id="page_040"></a></p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. She is not. [<i>Uxoriously.</i>] Come in, dearest.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Dearest enters, carrying the sword. She might have had the sense
not to bring it in while this annoying person is here.</i></p></div>

<p>L<small>ADY</small> S<small>IMS</small>. [<i>Thinking she has brought her welcome with her.</i>] Harry, the
sword has come.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Who will dote on it presently.</i>] Oh, all right.</p>

<p>L<small>ADY</small> S<small>IMS</small>. But I thought you were so eager to practise with it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The person smiles at this. He wishes he had not looked to see if
she was smiling.</i></p></div>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>Sharply.</i>] Put it down.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Lady Sims</span> <i>flushes a little as she lays the sword aside</i>.</p></div>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. [<i>With her confounded courtesy.</i>] It is a beautiful sword, if I
may say so.</p>

<p>L<small>ADY</small> S<small>IMS</small>. [<i>Helped.</i>] Yes.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The person thinks she can put him in the wrong, does she? He'll
show her.</i></p></div>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. [<i>With one eye on</i> <span class="smcap">Kate</span>.] Emmy, the one thing your neck needs
is more jewels.</p>

<p>L<small>ADY</small> S<small>IMS</small>. [<i>Faltering.</i>] More!</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. Some ropes of pearls. I'll see to it. It's a bagatelle to me.
[<span class="smcap">Kate</span> <i>conceals her chagrin, so she had better be shown the door. He
rings.</i>] I won't detain you any longer, miss.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. Thank you.</p>

<p>L<small>ADY</small> S<small>IMS</small>. Going already? You have been very quick.</p>

<p>S<small>IR</small> H<small>ARRY</small>. The person doesn't suit, Emmy.</p>

<p>L<small>ADY</small> S<small>IMS</small>. I'm sorry.</p>

<p>K<small>ATE</small>. So am I, madam, but it can't be helped. Good-by, your
ladyship&mdash;good-by, Sir Harry.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>There is a suspicion of an impertinent courtesy, and she is

<p class="cb">GEORGE MIDDLETON</p>

<p>George Middleton, one of the first to write and publish a volume of
one-act plays in America, was born in Paterson, New Jersey, 1880. He was
graduated from Columbia University in 1902. Since 1921 he has been
literary editor of <i>La Follette's Weekly</i>, and, in addition, has been a
frequent contributor to magazines and reviews on dramatic and literary
subjects. During the last few years he has spent much of his time
abroad.</p>

<p>George Middleton's chiefest interest has been in the one-act play. He
has been an ardent champion of the shorter form of drama. Among his
three volumes of one-act plays are <i>Embers</i> (including <i>The Failures</i>,
<i>The Gargoyle</i>, <i>In His House</i>, <i>Madonna</i>, and <i>The Man Masterful</i>),
<i>Tradition</i> (including <i>On Bail</i>, <i>Their Wife</i>, <i>Waiting</i>, <i>The Cheat of
Pity</i>, and <i>Mothers</i>), and <i>Possession</i> (including <i>The Grove</i>, <i>A Good
Woman</i>, <i>The Black Tie</i>, <i>Circles</i>, and <i>The Unborn</i>). Other one-act
plays are <i>Criminals</i> and <i>The Reason</i>. His longer plays are <i>Nowadays</i>
and <i>The Road Together</i>. Mr. Middleton has lectured widely on the
one-act play before colleges, in Little Theatres, and clubs. Perhaps his
most notable article is <i>The Neglected One-Act Play</i>, which appeared in
<i>The New York Dramatic Mirror</i> in 1912.</p>

<p><i>Tradition</i> is one of Mr. Middleton's best and most popular one-act
plays; and it most nearly conforms to the organic technic of the one-act
play.<a name="page_046" id="page_046"></a></p>

<p class="hang">SCENE: <i>The sitting-room at the</i> <span class="smcap">Ollivants'</span> <i>in a small town
up-State. It is an evening late in the spring.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>A simple room is disclosed, bearing the traces of another
generation. Old-fashioned window-doors at the right, overlooking
the garden, open on a porch; another door in back opening on the
hall-way. A large fire-place at the left, now concealed by an
embroidered screen; the horsehair furniture, several terra-cotta
statuettes, and a woodcut or two on the walls create the subtle
atmosphere of the past. There is a lamp on the table, and another
on a bracket by the door in back. Moonlight filters through the
window-doors.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Ollivants</span> <i>are discovered together</i>. <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, <i>a rather plain
woman of about twenty-five, with a suggestion of quick
sensibilities, is standing, lost in thought, looking out into the
garden. Her mother</i>, <span class="smcap">Emily</span>, <i>nearing fifty, quiet and subdued in
manner, is seated at the table trimming a hat. Occasionally she
looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, <i>stops her work, glances at her husband, closes her
eyes as though tired, and then resumes. The silence continues for
some time, broken only by the rattle of the town paper which</i>
<span class="smcap">George Ollivant</span> <i>is reading. He is well on in middle life, with a
strong, determined face not entirely without elements of kindness
and deep feeling. When he finishes, he folds the paper, puts it on
the table, knocks the ashes carefully from his pipe into his hand,
and throws them behind the screen; takes<a name="page_048" id="page_048"></a> off his spectacles and
wipes them as he, too, looks over toward his daughter, still gazing
absently into the garden. Finally, after a slight hesitation, he
goes to her and puts his arm about her; she is startled but smiles
sweetly.</i></p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>Affectionately.</i>] Glad to be home again, Mary?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. [<i>Evasively.</i>] The garden is so pretty.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Hasn't changed much, eh?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. It seems different; perhaps it's the night.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. I guess it isn't up to its usual standard. Haven't seen your
mother there so often this spring.</p>

<p>E<small>MILY</small>. [<i>Quietly.</i>] This dry spell is not good for flowers.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. It's only the cultivated flowers that need care; can't help
thinking that when I see the wild ones so hardy in my fields on the
hill. [<i>Turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Emily</span> <i>and patting her</i>.] Is there any of that spray
mixture left, Emily, dear?</p>

<p>E<small>MILY</small>. I haven't looked lately.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. I'll order some to-morrow. [<i>Taking up his pipe again and
looking for the tobacco.</i>] Think it would be a good idea, daughter, if
you'd spray those rosebushes every couple of weeks. The bugs are a pest
this spring. Where's my tobacco?</p>

<p>E<small>MILY</small>. On the mantel.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Wish you would always leave it on the table; you know how I
hate to have things changed.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Ollivant</span> <i>goes to the mantel, filling his pipe, and while his back
is turned</i>, <span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>makes a quick questioning gesture to her mother,

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. How's Ben been doing these two years, father?</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Hasn't your brother written you?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. Only once&mdash;when I left home; he disapproved, too.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Had an older brother's feeling of wanting to take care of you,
Mary.<a name="page_049" id="page_049"></a></p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. Yes; I know. How's he doing?</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. He's commencing to get on his feet. Takes time and money for
any one to get started these days.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. But he's still in partnership with Bert Taylor, isn't he?</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Yes. He'd have been somewhere if he'd worked in with me as I
did with <i>my</i> father. Things should be handed down. Offered him the
chance, tried to make him take it, as your mother knows; but that
college chum&mdash;nice enough fellow, I've heard&mdash;turned his head another
way. [<i>Lighting his pipe and puffing slowly.</i>] It's best to humor a
young fellow's ideas if he sticks them out, but I'd like to have had us
all here together now. The place is big enough even if he should want to
marry. Your mother and I came here, you know, when your grandfather was
still alive.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. Then Ben isn't making any money?</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>Reluctantly.</i>] Not yet&mdash;to speak of.</p>

<p>E<small>MILY</small>. [<i>Quietly.</i>] But he's promised to pay his father back, Mary.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. I see. [<i>Thoughtfully.</i>] College and then more help to get
started, because he's a man.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>Complacently.</i>] He'll have to support a family some day;
I've had to keep that in mind.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. I'd like to have a real talk with him.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. When did his letter say he'd be coming for a visit, Emily?</p>

<p>E<small>MILY</small>. The fifteenth.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. Not till then? That's too bad.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Eh?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. [<i>After exchanging a quick glance with her mother and gaining
courage.</i>] Father, I hope you didn't misunderstand my coming back?</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Not at all. We all make mistakes&mdash;especially when we're young.
Perhaps I was a bit hasty when you left<a name="page_050" id="page_050"></a> home, but I knew you'd soon see
I was right. I didn't think it would take you two years&mdash;but perhaps if
I'd written you before you'd have come sooner. I told your mother I'd
like to make it easy for you to come home.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. Mother suggested that you write me?</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Well, I suppose you might put it that way. I always felt she
thought I was a bit hard on you, but I'm not one to back down easily.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. Don't blame me then, father, if I showed I was your daughter.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Let's forget my feeling; but naturally I was set back.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. Because you didn't take my going seriously until I was actually
leaving.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. I couldn't get it into my head then, and I can't now, how any
girl would want to leave a home like this, where you have everything.
You don't know how lucky you are&mdash;or maybe you have realized it. Look
about you and see what other girls have. Is it like this? Trees,
flowers, and a lake view that's the best in the county. Why, one can
breathe here and even taste the air. Every time I come back from a
business trip it makes a new man of me. Ask your mother. Eh, Emily? When
I sit out there on the porch in the cool evenings it makes me feel at
ease with the world to know that the place is <i>mine</i> and that I've
raised a family and can take care of them all. Ben had to go, I
suppose&mdash;it's the way with sons; but I thought you, at least, would stay
here, daughter, in this old house where you were born, where I was born,
where all your early associations&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. [<i>Shuddering.</i>] I hate associations.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>Eying her.</i>] Well, I'd like to know where you get <i>that</i>
from. Not from your mother and me. <i>We</i> like them, don't we, Emily? Why,
your mother's hardly ever even left here&mdash;but you had to up and get out.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. Yes. That's right, father; I <i>had</i> to.<a name="page_051" id="page_051"></a></p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>He stops smoking and looks at her sharply.</i>] Had to? Who
made you?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. [<i>Reluctantly.</i>] It was something inside me.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>In spite of himself.</i>] Tush&mdash;that foolishness.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. [<i>Quickly.</i>] Don't make it hard for us again.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. I made it hard, Mary? Because I objected to your leaving your
mother here alone?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. I remember; you said I was a foolish, "stage-struck" girl.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Well, you're over <i>that</i>, aren't you?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. That's just where you are mistaken, father. [<i>Slowly.</i>] That's why
I asked you if you hadn't misunderstood my coming back.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>Suspiciously.</i>] Then why did you come at all?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. I'm human; I wanted to see you and mother, so I came when you
generously wrote me. I'm not going to stay and spray the roses.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>He eyes her tensely and controls himself with an effort.</i>]
So you are not going to stay with your mother and me?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. [<i>Affectionately.</i>] I'll come see you as often as I can and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>.&mdash;and make a hotel of your home? [<span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>is silent</i>.] Don't you
see your mother is getting older and needs somebody to be here?</p>

<p>E<small>MILY</small>. [<i>With a quiet assurance.</i>] I have never been so well and
contented.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>Tenderly.</i>] I know better, Emily; can't I see you're getting
thinner and older? [<i>Stopping her protests.</i>] Now, let me manage this,
dear. It's a girl's place to stay at home. You know my feelings about
that. Suppose anything should happen to your mother, what would <i>I</i> do?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. So it's not mother alone you are thinking of?</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>Tersely.</i>] I'm thinking of your place at home&mdash;doing a
woman's work. I'm not proud of having my daughter<a name="page_052" id="page_052"></a> off earning her own
living as though I couldn't support her.</p>

<p>E<small>MILY</small>. George!</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. I thought it was only because I was on the stage.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Well, it's not the most heavenly place, is it? A lot of
narrow-minded fools here in town thought I was crazy to <i>let</i> you go; I
knew how they felt; I grinned and bore it. You were my daughter and I
loved you, and I didn't want them to think any less of you by their
finding out you were leaving against my wish.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. [<i>Slowly, with comprehension.</i>] That's what hurt you.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Well, I blamed myself a bit for taking you to plays and liking
them myself.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. People here will soon forget about me and merely be sorry for you.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>Persuasively.</i>] Why, Mary. I've made it easy for you to
stay. I told every one you were coming home for good. They'll think me a
fool if&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. [<i>Tenderly.</i>] You meant what was dear and good, father; but you
had no right to say that. I'm sorry.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. I did it because I thought you had come to your senses.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. [<i>Firmly.</i>] I never saw so clearly as I do now.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>Bluntly.</i>] Then you're stubborn&mdash;plain stubborn&mdash;not to
admit failure.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. [<i>Startled.</i>] Failure?</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. I know what the newspapers said; Ben sent them to me.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. Which ones?</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Why, all of them, I guess.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. Did he send you the good ones?</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Were there any?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. Oh, I see. So Ben carefully picked out only those which would
please you.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>Sarcastically.</i>] Please me?<a name="page_053" id="page_053"></a></p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. Yes; because you and he didn't want me to succeed; because you
thought failure would bring me home. But don't you think I'll let some
cub reporter settle things for me. I'll never come home through
failure&mdash;never.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>Kindly.</i>] Ben and I only want to protect you, Mary.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. Why do men always want to protect women?</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Because we know the world.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. Yes; but you don't know <i>me</i>. Father, you still think I'm only a
foolish, stage-struck girl, and want flowers and men and my name in big
letters. It isn't that.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Well, what is it, then?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. Oh&mdash;I want to be an artist. I don't suppose you can understand it;
I didn't, myself, at first. I was born with it, but didn't know what it
was till that first time you took me to the theatre.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. So it was all my fault?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. It isn't anybody's fault; it's just a fact. I knew from that day
what I wanted to do. I wanted to act&mdash;to create. I don't care whether I
play a leading lady or a scrub-woman, if I can do it with truth and
beauty.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Well, you haven't done much of either, have you? What have you
got to show for our unhappiness? What have you got ahead of you?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. Nothing&mdash;definite.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>Incredulously.</i>] Yet, you're going to keep at it?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. Yes.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. What do you think of that, Emily?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. I am going to the city Monday.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>Persistently.</i>] But what will you do when you get there?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. What I've done before: hunt a job, tramp the streets, call at the
offices, be snubbed and insulted by office-boys&mdash;keep at it till I get
something to do.<a name="page_054" id="page_054"></a></p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Come, come, Mary; don't make me lose patience. Put your pride
in your pocket. You've had your fling. You've tried and failed. Give it
all up and stay home here where you can be comfortable.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. [<i>With intense feeling.</i>] Father, I can't give it up. It doesn't
make any difference how they treat me, how many times I get my "notice"
and don't even make good according to their standards. I can't give it
up. I simply can't. It keeps gnawing inside me and driving me on. It's
there&mdash;always there, and I know if I keep at work I will succeed. I know
it; I know it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>throws herself into the chair, much stirred</i>. <span class="smcap">Emily's</span> <i>eyes
have eagerly followed her throughout this as though responding
sympathetically, but</i> <span class="smcap">Ollivant</span> <i>has stood in silence, watching her
apparently without comprehension</i>.]</p></div>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>Not without kindness.</i>] Something inside. Huh! Have you any
clear idea what she's talking about, Emily?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>gives a short, hurt cry and goes quickly to the window,
looking out and controlling herself with an effort</i>.]</p></div>

<p>E<small>MILY</small>. [<i>Softly, as she looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>.] I think I understand.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. I don't. Something inside. I never had anything like that
bothering me. What's it all mean?</p>

<p>E<small>MILY</small>. [<i>Quietly.</i>] So many people use the same words, but cannot
understand each other.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Well, you seem to think it's mighty important Mary, whatever
it is; but it's too much for me. If you had something to show for it I
wouldn't mind. But you're just where you started and you might as well
give up.</p>

<p>E<small>MILY</small>. George!</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Now I don't know much about the stage, Emily, but Ben does. He
says you're not made for an actress, Mary; you haven't got a chance.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. [<i>Turning.</i>] Father!</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Can't you see your failure isn't your own fault? If you were a
beauty like Helen Safford or some of those other<a name="page_055" id="page_055"></a> "stars"&mdash;but you're
not pretty, why, you're not even good-looking and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. [<i>With bitter vehemence</i>.] Oh, don't go any further. I know all
that. But I don't care how I look off the stage if only I can grow
beautiful on it. I'll create with so much inner power and beauty that
people will forget how I look and only see what I think and feel. I can
do it; I have done it; I've made audiences feel and even got my "notice"
because the stage-manager said I was "too natural." Helen
Safford&mdash;what's she? A professional beauty with everything outside and
nothing in. You think of her eyes, her mouth, and her profile; but does
she touch you so you remember? I know her work. Wait till I get a chance
to play a scene with her&mdash;which they may give me because I'm not
good-looking&mdash;I'll make them forget she's on the stage the first ten
minutes&mdash;yes, and you and Ben, too, if you'll come. Helen Safford? Huh!
Why, people will remember me when she's only a lithograph.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Well, then, why haven't you had your chance?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. [<i>Quickly.</i>] Because most managers feel the way you and Ben do.
And not having a lovely profile and a fashion-plate figure stands
between me and a chance even to read a part, let alone play it. That's
what eats the heart out of me, mother; and makes me hate my face every
time I sit down to put on the grease paint.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Well, don't blame me for that.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. [<i>Going to her mother, who takes her hand.</i>] You can laugh at me,
father; you don't understand. It's foolish to talk. But, oh, mother, why
is such beauty given to women like Helen Safford who have no inner need
of it, and here am I, with a real creative gift, wrapped up in a
nondescript package which stands between me and everything I want to do?
[<i>With determination.</i>] But I will&mdash;ultimately I will make good, in
spite of my looks; others have. And what I've suffered will make me a
greater artist.<a name="page_056" id="page_056"></a></p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>In a matter-of-fact tone.</i>] Are you sure all this isn't
overconfidence and vanity?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. I don't care what you call it. It's what keeps me working.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>Quickly.</i>] Working? But how can you work without an
engagement?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. That <i>is</i> the hard part of our life; waiting, waiting for a chance
to work. But don't think I stand still when I haven't an engagement. I
don't dare. That's why I keep at my voice work and dancing and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>Suddenly interrupting.</i>] Dancing and voice work when you
have no engagements. Would you mind telling me who is paying the bills?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. [<i>Indignantly.</i>] Father!</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. I think I have the right to ask that.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. Have you?</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. I am your father.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. [<i>With quiet dignity.</i>] You thought you'd force me here at home to
do as you wished because you paid for my food and clothes; when you took
that from me you <i>ceased</i> to have that right. Don't forget since I left
you've not helped me with my work or given me a penny.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>Suspiciously.</i>] Mary.... No, that's not why you went away
from home?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. No.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Or you met some man <i>there</i> and....</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. No.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. There is some man.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. Why a <i>man</i>?</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Damn them; I know them. [<i>Breaking.</i>] Good God, Mary, dear,
you haven't ...? Answer me, daughter.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. [<i>Calmly.</i>] No, there's been no need of that.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He has been violently shaken at the thought, looks at her
intently, believes her, and then continues in a subdued manner.</i></p></div>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Then who helped you? Ben?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. How could he help me? Are men the only ones who help women?</p>

<p>E<small>MILY</small>. [<i>Quietly.</i>] Tell him, Mary; it's best now.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>Turning slowly to her in surprise.</i>] You knew and have kept
it from me?</p>

<p>E<small>MILY</small>. [<i>Calmly, as she puts down the hat she has been trimming.</i>] I
found I hadn't lost my old skill, though it's been a good many years
since I held a brush&mdash;since before we were married, George. I had an
idea I thought would sell: paper dolls with little hand-painted dresses
on separate sheets; they were so much softer than the printed kind, and
children like anything soft. I wrote to Mr. Aylwin&mdash;you remember&mdash;he was
so kind to me years before. He had called here once before when you were
away and asked after my work. He used to think I had such promise. He
found an opportunity to use the dolls as a specialty, and when I
explained he induced some other firms to use all I can paint, too. They
pay me very well. I made enough each month to help Mary when she went
behind.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>Incredulously.</i>] You! After you heard me say when she left I
wouldn't give her a cent?</p>

<p>E<small>MILY</small>. [<i>Looking fondly at</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>.] You were keeping Ben, weren't you?</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. But&mdash;that's&mdash;that's different.</p>

<p>E<small>MILY</small>. I didn't see why we shouldn't help <i>both</i> our children.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>Perplexed by this he turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>.] And you took it?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. Yes.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. You knew how she got the money?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. Yes.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Your mother working herself sick for you, and you took it?</p>

<p>E<small>MILY</small>. I told you I've never been so happy.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. [<i>Simply.</i>] I couldn't bargain with what I felt. I had to study.
I'd have taken anything, gotten it anywhere. I<a name="page_058" id="page_058"></a> had to live. You didn't
help me. Ben and I both went against your will, but you helped him
because he was your son. I was only your daughter.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Ollivant</span> <i>eyes her and seems to be struggling with himself. He is
silent a long while as they both watch him. Finally, after several
efforts he speaks with emotion.</i>]</p></div>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Mary, I&mdash;I didn't realize how much you meant to me till&mdash;till
I thought of what might have happened to you without my help.
Would&mdash;would you have stayed on in the city if&mdash;if your mother hadn't
helped you?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. [<i>Firmly.</i>] Yes, father; I would have stayed on.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>After a pause.</i>] Then I guess what you <i>feel</i> is stronger
than all your mother and I tried to teach you.... Are you too proud to
take help from me&mdash;now?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. [<i>Simply.</i>] No, father; till I succeed. Then I'll pay you back
like Ben promised.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>Hurt.</i>] You don't think it was the money, daughter? It would
have cost to keep you here. It wasn't that.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. No; it was your father speaking and his father and his father.
[<i>Looking away wistfully.</i>] And perhaps I was speaking for those before
me who were silent or couldn't be heard.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>With sincerity.</i>] I don't exactly understand <i>that</i> any more
than the feeling you spoke of driving you from home. But I do see what
you mean about brothers and sisters. You seem to think boys and girls
are the same. But they're not. Men and women are different. You may not
know it, but your mother had foolish ideas like you have when I first
knew her. She was poor and didn't have a mother to support her, and she
had to work for a living. She'd about given up when I met her&mdash;trying to
work at night to feed herself in the day while studying. But she was
sensible; when a good man came along who could support her she married
him and settled down. Look how happy she's been here with a home of her
own that is a home&mdash;<a name="page_059" id="page_059"></a>with associations and children. Where would she be,
struggling to-day trying to paint pictures for a living? Why, there's
lots of men who can paint pictures, and too few good wives for
hard-working, decent men who want a family&mdash;which is God's law. You'll
find that out one of these days and you'll give yourself as she did.
Some day a man will come and you'll want to marry him. How could you if
you keep on with your work, going about the country?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. [<i>Quietly.</i>] You leave mother at times, don't you?</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. I've got to.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. So may I.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. And the children?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. They'd have a share of my life.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. A mighty big share if you're human, I tell you. Ask your
mother if you think they're easy coming and bringing up.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. And now they've left her. Dear mother, what has she to do?</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Well, if you ever get a husband with those ideas of yours
you'll see what a wife has to do. [<i>He goes to her.</i>] Mary, it isn't
easy, all this you've been saying. But your mother and I are left alone,
and perhaps we <i>have</i> got different views than you. But if ever you do
see it our way, and give up or fail&mdash;- well, come back to us,
understand?</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. [<i>Going to him and kissing him.</i>] I understand how hard it was for
you to say that. And remember I may come back a success.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Yes. I suppose they all think that; it's what keeps them
going. But some day, when you're in love and marry, you'll see it all
differently.</p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. Father, what if the man does not come&mdash;or the children?</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. Why&mdash;[<i>He halts as though unable to answer her.</i>] Nonsense.
He'll come, never fear; they always do.<a name="page_060" id="page_060"></a></p>

<p>M<small>ARY</small>. I wonder.</p>

<p>O<small>LLIVANT</small>. [<i>He goes affectionately to</i> <span class="smcap">Emily</span><i>, who has been staring
before her during this</i>.] Emily, dear. No wonder the flowers have been
neglected. Well, you'll have time to spray those roses yourself. I'll
get the spray mixture to-morrow. [<i>Kisses her tenderly.</i>] Painting paper
dolls with a change of clothes! When I might have been sending her the
money without ever feeling it. No more of that, dear; you don't have to

<p class="cb">ALTHEA THURSTON</p>

<p>Althea Cooms-Thurston, one of the promising writers of the younger set
of American dramatists, was born in Iowa, but soon moved with her
parents to Colorado, where she spent her girlhood. She was educated in
the public schools of Colorado Springs and Denver. Her collegiate
training was received in the University of Utah, Salt Lake City. In 1902
she married Walter R. Thurston, a well-known engineer. At present she
resides in Dallas, Texas.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thurston has travelled widely and has resided for periods of time
in Mexico City and Havana, Cuba. She is an able linguist and has made a
special study of her native English tongue and of Spanish and French,
all of which she uses fluently.</p>

<p>From childhood she has shown dramatic ability. Her dramatic composition
has been more or less directly associated with the courses in
playwriting and the history of the drama which she completed in the
University of Utah. Among her one-act plays are <i>When a Man's Hungry</i>,
<i>And the Devil Laughs</i>, and <i>The Exchange</i>.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thurston has an aptitude for delicate and satirical farce. <i>The
Exchange</i> is an excellent example of farce-comedy in the contemporary
one-act play.<a name="page_064" id="page_064"></a></p>

<h3>SCENE I</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>The curtain rises upon an office scene. Seemingly there is nothing
unusual about this office: it has tables, chairs, a filing cabinet,
and a hat-rack. A portion of the office is railed off at the right.
Within this enclosed space is a commodious desk and swivel-chair;
and the filing cabinet stands against the wall. This railed-off
portion of the office belongs, exclusively, to the</i> <span class="smcap">Judge</span>. <i>Here he
is wont to spend many hours&mdash;sometimes to read or write, and again,
perhaps, he will just sit and ponder upon the vagaries of mankind.
The</i> <span class="smcap">Judge</span> <i>is a tall, spare man with rather long gray hair, which
shows beneath the skull-cap that he always wears. When we first see
him, he is reading a letter, and evidently he is not pleased, for
he is tapping with impatient fingers upon his desk.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>At the left of the stage is a heavily curtained door which leads
to an inner room. At centre rear is another door which evidently
leads to the street, as it is through this door that the</i> <span class="smcap">Poor Man</span>,
<i>the</i> <span class="smcap">Vain Woman</span>, <i>and the</i> <span class="smcap">Rich Citizen</span> <i>will presently enter,
each upon his special quest. The hat-rack stands near the street
door, and we glimpse a soft black hat and a long black overcoat
hanging upon it.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Down stage to the left is a flat-topped desk, littered with papers
and letters. This desk has two large drawers, wherein a number of
miscellaneous articles might be kept. It is at this desk that we
catch our first glimpse of</i> <span class="smcap">Imp</span>. <i>He is busily writing in a huge<a name="page_066" id="page_066"></a>
ledger, and he seems to be enjoying his work, for he chuckles the
while.</i> <span class="smcap">Imp</span> <i>is a little rogue; he looks it and acts it, and we
feel that he has a Mephistophelian spirit. He wears a dark-green
tight-fitting uniform, trimmed with red braid. His saucy little
round cap is always cocked over one eye. He is ever chuckling
impishly, and we feel that he is slyly gleeful over the weaknesses
of mankind and the difficulties that beset them.</i></p>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>I<small>MP</small>. [<i>Throws down his pen, chuckles, and half standing on the rungs of
his chair and balancing himself against his desk, surveys the ledger.</i>]
Your honor, I've all the miseries listed to date and a fine lot there is
to choose from. Everything from bunions to old wives for exchange.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Scowls and impatiently taps the letter he is reading.</i>] Here is
another one. A woman suspects her husband of a misalliance. Wants to
catch him, but is so crippled with rheumatism she can't get about. Wants
us to exchange her rheumatism for something that won't interfere with
either her walking or her eyesight.</p>

<p>I<small>MP</small>. [<i>Referring to the ledger and running his finger along the lines.</i>]
We have a defective heart or a lazy liver that we could give her.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Irritably tossing the letter over to</i> <span class="smcap">Imp</span>.] She would not be
satisfied. People never are. They always want to change their miseries,
but never their vices. Each thinks his own cross heavier than others
have to bear, but he is very willing to make light of his own weaknesses
and shortcomings. He thinks they are not half so bad as his neighbor's.
I have tried for years to aid distressed humanity, but I can't satisfy
them. I am growing tired of it all, Imp. People need a lesson and
they're going to get it, too. I am going to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Knock is heard at the street door.</i> <span class="smcap">Judge</span> <i>sighs, turns to his
desk and begins to write</i>. <span class="smcap">Imp</span> <i>sweeps the litter of papers on his
desk into a drawer, closes ledger, and goes to answer knock</i>.</p></div>

<p>I<small>MP</small>. Here comes another misery.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Imp</span> <i>opens the door to admit the</i> <span class="smcap">Poor Man</span>, <i>who is very shabbily
dressed. He hesitates, looks around the room as if he were in the
wrong place, and then addresses</i> <span class="smcap">Imp</span> <i>in a loud whisper</i>.</p></div>

<p>P<small>OOR</small> M<small>AN</small>. [<i>Indicating the</i> <span class="smcap">Judge</span> <i>with a motion of his head</i>.] Is that
him?</p>

<p>I<small>MP</small>. [<i>Whispering loudly his reply.</i>] Yes, that is his honor.</p>

<p>P<small>OOR</small> M<small>AN</small>. [<i>Still whispering and showing signs of nervousness.</i>] Do I
dare speak to him?</p>

<p>I<small>MP</small>. [<i>Enjoying the situation and still whispering.</i>] Yes, but be
careful what you say.</p>

<p>P<small>OOR</small> M<small>AN</small>. [<i>Takes off his hat, approaches slowly to the railing, and
speaks humbly.</i>] Your honor. I&mdash;[<i>Swallows hard, clears throat.</i>] Your
honor, I've a little favor&mdash;to ask of you.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Looking coldly at the</i> <span class="smcap">Poor Man</span>.] Well?</p>

<p>P<small>OOR</small> M<small>AN</small>. You see, your honor, I've been poor all my life. I've never
had much fun. I don't ask for a lot of money, but&mdash;I would like enough
so that I could have some swell clothes, and&mdash;so that I could eat,
drink, and be merry with the boys. You know, I just want to have a good
time. Do you think you could fix it for me, Judge?</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Gazes at him sternly for a moment.</i>] So you just want to have a
good time? Want me to take away your poverty? I suppose you have no
moral weakness you want to change, no defects in your character that you
want to better?</p>

<p>P<small>OOR</small> M<small>AN</small>. [<i>Stammering and twirling his hat.</i>] Why, w-hy, Judge, I&mdash;I am
not a bad man. Of&mdash;of course, I have my faults, but then&mdash;I've never
committed any crimes. I guess I stack up pretty fair as men go. I'm just
awful tired of being poor and never having any fun. Couldn't you help me
out on that point, Judge?</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Sighs wearily and turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Imp</span>.] Bring me the ledger.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Imp</span> <i>gives him the ledger in which he has been writing</i>. <span class="smcap">Judge</span>
<i>opens it, and then speaks sharply to the</i> <span class="smcap">Poor Man</span>.</p></div>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. You understand, do you, my good man, that if I take away your
poverty and give you enough money for your good time, you will have to
accept another misery?</p>

<p>P<small>OOR</small> M<small>AN</small>. [<i>Eagerly.</i>] Yes, your honor, that's all right. I'm willing.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Scanning ledger.</i>] Very well. Let us see. Here is paralysis.</p>

<p>P<small>OOR</small> M<small>AN</small>. [<i>Hesitatingly.</i>] Well. I&mdash;I couldn't have a&mdash;very good time,
if&mdash;if I was paralyzed.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Shortly.</i>] No. I suppose not. How about a glass eye?</p>

<p>P<small>OOR</small> M<small>AN</small>. [<i>Anxiously.</i>] Please, your honor, if I'm going to have a good
time I need two good eyes. I don't want to miss anything.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Wearily turning over the leaves of the ledger.</i>] A man left his
wife here for exchange, perhaps you would like her.</p>

<p>P<small>OOR</small> M<small>AN</small>. [<i>Shifting from one foot to the other and nervously twirling
his hat.</i>] Oh, Judge, oh, no, please, no. I don't want anybody's old
cast-off wife.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Becoming exasperated.</i>] Well, choose something, and be quick
about it. Here is lumbago, gout, fatness, old age, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I<small>MP</small>. [<i>Interrupting, and walking quickly over to the railing.</i>] Excuse
me, Judge, but maybe the gentleman would like the indigestion that Mr.
Potter left when he took old Mrs. Pratt's fallen arches.</p>

<p>P<small>OOR</small> M<small>AN</small>. [<i>Eagerly.</i>] Indigestion? Sure! That will be fine! I won't
mind a little thing like indigestion if I can get rid of my poverty.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Sternly.</i>] Very well. Raise your right hand. Repeat after me:
"I swear to accept indigestion for better or for worse as my portion of
the world's miseries, so help me God."</p>

<p>P<small>OOR</small> M<small>AN</small>. [<i>Solemnly.</i>] "I swear to accept indigestion for better or for
worse as my portion of the world's miseries, so help me God."<a name="page_069" id="page_069"></a></p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Imp</span>.] Show this gentleman to the changing-room.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Poor Man</span> <i>follows</i> <span class="smcap">Imp</span>, <i>who conducts him to the heavily curtained
door. The</i> <span class="smcap">Poor Man</span> <i>throws out his chest and swaggers a bit, as a
man might who had suddenly come into a fortune</i>. <span class="smcap">Imp</span> <i>swaggers
along with him</i>.</p></div>

<p>I<small>MP</small>. Won't you have a grand time, though. I'll get you a menu card, so
that you can be picking out your dinner.</p>

<p>P<small>OOR</small> M<small>AN</small>. [<i>Joyfully slapping</i> <span class="smcap">Imp</span> <i>on the back</i>.] Good idea, and I'll
pick out a regular banquet.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Pausing a moment before he passes through the curtains, he smiles
and smacks his lips in anticipation. Exit.</i></p></div>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Speaks disgustedly to</i> <span class="smcap">Imp</span>.] There you are! He's perfectly
satisfied with his morals. Has no defects in his character. Just wants
to have a good time.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Sighs heavily and turns back to his writing.</i> <span class="smcap">Imp</span> <i>nods his head
in agreement and chuckles slyly</i>.</p>

<p>[<i>The street door opens slowly and the</i> <span class="smcap">Vain Woman</span> <i>stands upon the
threshold. She does not enter at once, but stands
posing&mdash;presumably she desires to attract attention, and she is
worthy of it. She has a superb figure, and her rich gowning
enhances it. Her fair face reveals a shallow prettiness, but the
wrinkles of age are beginning to leave telltale lines upon its
smoothness. As</i> <span class="smcap">Imp</span> <i>hurries forward to usher her in, she sweeps
grandly past him to the centre of the stage</i>. <span class="smcap">Imp</span> <i>stops near the
door, with his hands on his hips, staring after her, then takes a
few steps in imitation of her. She turns around slowly and,
sauntering over to the railing, coughs affectedly, and as the</i>
<span class="smcap">Judge</span> <i>rises and bows curtly, she speaks in a coaxing manner</i>.</p></div>

<p>V<small>AIN</small> W<small>OMAN</small>. Judge, I have heard that you are very kind, and I have been
told that you help people out of their troubles, so I have a little
favor to ask of you.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Coldly.</i>] Yes, I supposed so; go on.</p>

<p>V<small>AIN</small> W<small>OMAN</small>. [<i>Archly.</i>] Well, you know that I am a famous<a name="page_070" id="page_070"></a> beauty; in
fact, both my face and my form are considered very lovely. [<i>She turns
around slowly that he may see for himself.</i>] Great and celebrated men
have worshipped at my feet. I simply cannot live without admiration. It
is my very life. But, Judge [<i>plaintively</i>], horrid wrinkles are
beginning to show in my face. [<i>Intensely.</i>] Oh, I would give anything,
do anything, to have a smooth, youthful face once more. Please, oh,
please, won't you take away these wrinkles [<i>touching her face with her
fingers</i>] and give me something in their stead.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Looking directly at her and speaking coldly.</i>] Are you
satisfied with yourself in other ways? Is your character as beautiful as
your face? Have you no faults or weaknesses that you want exchanged?</p>

<p>V<small>AIN</small> W<small>OMAN</small>. [<i>Uncertainly.</i>] Why, I&mdash;don't know what you mean. I am just
as good as any other woman and lots better than some I know. I go to
church, and I subscribe to the charities, and I belong to the best
clubs. [<i>Anxiously.</i>] Oh, please, Judge, it's these wrinkles that make
me so unhappy. Won't you exchange them? You don't want me to be unhappy,
do you? Please take them away.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Wearily looking over the ledger.</i>] Oh, very well, I'll see what
I can do for you. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Imp</span>.] Fetch a chair for this lady.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Imp</span> <i>gives her a chair and she sits facing front</i>. <span class="smcap">Imp</span> <i>returns to
his desk, perches himself upon it and watches the</i> <span class="smcap">Vain Woman</span>
<i>interestedly</i>. <span class="smcap">Judge</span> <i>turns over the leaves of the ledger</i>.</p></div>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. I have a goitre that I could exchange for your wrinkles.</p>

<p>V<small>AIN</small> W<small>OMAN</small>. [<i>Protestingly, clasping her hands to her throat.</i>] Oh,
heavens, no! That would ruin my beautiful throat. See. [<i>Throwing back
her fur and exposing her neck in a low-cut gown.</i>] I have a lovely neck.
[<span class="smcap">Imp</span> <i>makes an exaggerated attempt to see</i>.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Glances coldly at her and then scans ledger again.</i>] Well, how
about hay-fever?<a name="page_071" id="page_071"></a></p>

<p>V<small>AIN</small> W<small>OMAN</small>. [<i>Reproachfully.</i>] Oh, Judge, how can you suggest such a
thing! Watery eyes and a red nose, the worst enemy of beauty there is. I
simply couldn't think of it. I want something that won't show.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Disgustedly turns to filing cabinet and looks through a series
of cards, withdraws one, and turns back to</i> <span class="smcap">Vain Woman</span>.] Perhaps this
will suit you. [<i>Refers to card.</i>] A woman has grown very tired of her
husband and wants to exchange him for some other burden.</p>

<p>V<small>AIN</small> W<small>OMAN</small>. [<i>Indignantly.</i>] What! I accept a man that some other woman
doesn't want! Certainly not! I prefer one that some other woman does
want.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Irritated, puts the card back in its place, and turns upon the</i>
<span class="smcap">Vain Woman</span> <i>crossly</i>.] I fear that I cannot please you and I do not have
time to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I<small>MP</small>. [<i>Interrupts and runs over to the railing, speaking soothingly to
the</i> <span class="smcap">Judge</span>.] Excuse me, Judge, but maybe the lady would like deafness in
exchange for her wrinkles. Deafness wouldn't show, so it couldn't spoil
her face or her elegant figure.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Wearily.</i>] No, it won't show. Deafness ought to be a good thing
for you.</p>

<p>V<small>AIN</small> W<small>OMAN</small>. [<i>Consideringly.</i>] Why&mdash;yes&mdash;that might do. But&mdash;well, it
wouldn't show. I've a notion to take it. [<i>Pause&mdash;she seems to consider
and meditate. The</i> <span class="smcap">Judge</span> <i>stares at her coldly</i>. <span class="smcap">Imp</span> <i>grins impudently.
She rises leisurely, sighs.</i>] All right. I'll accept it.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Sharply.</i>] Hold up your right hand. [<i>She raises hand.</i>] Do you
swear to accept deafness for better or for worse, as your portion of the
world's miseries, so help you God?</p>

<p>V<small>AIN</small> W<small>OMAN</small>. [<i>Sweetly.</i>] Oh, yes. I do, Judge.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Imp</span>.] Show the lady to the changing-room.</p>

<p>I<small>MP</small>. [<i>Escorts her to the curtained door with rather mock deference.</i>]
No, deafness won't show at all, and you'll have 'em all crazy about you.
[<i>Draws aside curtains for her to pass.</i>] Take second booth to your
right.<a name="page_072" id="page_072"></a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Vain Woman</span> <i>stands posing a moment. She smiles radiantly and pats
her cheeks softly with her hands, then with a long-drawn sigh of
happiness, she exits.</i> <span class="smcap">Imp</span> <i>bows low and mockingly after her
vanishing form, his hand on his heart</i>.</p></div>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Sarcastically.</i>] Do her faults or shortcomings trouble her? Not
at all! Perfectly satisfied with herself, except for a few wrinkles in
her face. Vain women! Bah!</p>

<p>I<small>MP</small>. Yes, sir; women have queer notions.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>An imperative rap at the street-door, immediately followed by the

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Shortly.</i>] You are.</p>

<p>R<small>ICH</small> C<small>ITIZEN</small>. [<i>Languidly, between puffs of his cigarette.</i>] Well,
Judge, life has become rather boresome, so I thought I would drop in and
ask you to do me a small favor.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Wearily.</i>] Yes? We&mdash;What is your grievance?</p>

<p>R<small>ICH</small> C<small>ITIZEN</small>. [<i>Nonchalantly.</i>] Oh, I wouldn't say grievance exactly.
You see, my dear Judge, it is this way. I am a very rich and influential
citizen, a prominent member of society, and I am very much sought after.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Frigidly.</i>] Oh, indeed!</p>

<p>R<small>ICH</small> C<small>ITIZEN</small>. [<i>In a very bored manner.</i>] Yes. Women run<a name="page_073" id="page_073"></a> after me day
and night. Ambitious mothers throw their marriageable daughters at my
head. Men seek my advice on all matters. I am compelled to head this and
that committee.</p>

<p class="r">[<i>Smokes languidly.</i></p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Sharply.</i>] Well, go on.</p>

<p>R<small>ICH</small> C<small>ITIZEN</small>. Really, Judge, my prestige has become a burden. I want to
get away from it all. I would like to become a plain, ordinary man with
an humble vocation, the humbler the better, so that people will cease
bothering me.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Sarcastically.</i>] Is your prestige all that troubles you? Don't
worry about your morals, I suppose. Satisfied with your habits and
character?</p>

<p>R<small>ICH</small> C<small>ITIZEN</small>. [<i>Coldly.</i>] What have my habits or morals got to do with
my request? [<i>Scornfully.</i>] Certainly I am not one of your saintly men.
I live as a man of my station should live, and I think I measure up very
well with the best of them. I am simply bored and I would like a change.
I would like to be a plain man with an humble calling.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Ironically.</i>] I'll see what we have in humble callings. [<i>He
looks at the ledger, turning the leaves over slowly.</i>] We have several
bartenders' vocations.</p>

<p>R<small>ICH</small> C<small>ITIZEN</small>. [<i>Wearily smoking.</i>] No. Too many people about all the
time, and too much noise.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. Well, here's a janitor's job open to you.</p>

<p>R<small>ICH</small> C<small>ITIZEN</small>. [<i>Impatiently throwing away his cigarette.</i>] No. I don't
like that, either. Too confining. Too many people bickering at you all
the time. I want to get out in the open, away from crowds.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Sighing, and turning over the leaves of the ledger, then
hopefully.</i>] Here's the very thing for you, then&mdash;postman in a rural

<p>R<small>ICH</small> C<small>ITIZEN</small>. [<i>Showing vexation.</i>] No, no, <i>no</i>. Too many old women

you something peaceful and quiet; something that would take me out in
the quiet of the early morning, when the birds are singing?</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Closing ledger with a bang, and rising.</i>] Well, you're too
particular, and I have not time to bother with you. I bid you good
after&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I<small>MP</small>. [<i>Slides from his desk, runs to railing, and speaks suavely.</i>]
Excuse me, Judge, but maybe the gentleman would like the vocation of
milkman. That is early-morning work. And, you remember, a milkman left
his job here when he took that old, worn-out senator's position.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Sharply, to</i> <span class="smcap">Rich Citizen</span>.] Well, how about it? Does a
milkman's vocation suit you? It's early-morning hours, fresh air, and no
people about.</p>

<p>R<small>ICH</small> C<small>ITIZEN</small>. [<i>Musingly.</i>] Well, the very simplicity and quietness of
it is its charm. It rather appeals to me. [<i>He ponders a moment.</i>] Yes,
by Jove, I'll take it.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>Sternly.</i>] Hold up your right hand. "Do you solemnly swear to
accept, for better or for worse, the vocation of milkman as your lot in
life, so help you God?"</p>

<p>R<small>ICH</small> C<small>ITIZEN</small>. I do.</p>

<p>J<small>UDGE</small>. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Imp</span>.] Show this gentleman to the changing-room.</p>

<p>I<small>MP</small>. [<i>While escorting him to the curtained door.</i>] Yes, sir, you will
lead the simple life. Fresh air, fresh milk, no people, just cows&mdash;and
they can't talk. [<i>Holding aside the curtains.</i>] Third booth, sir.</p>

<h3>SCENE II</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>A fortnight has passed. The curtain rises upon the same
stage-setting. The</i> <span class="smcap">Judge</span> <i>is not about, but we see</i> <span class="smcap">Imp</span> <i>asleep in
a chair. All seems quiet and serene. But suddenly the street-door
opens noisily, and the</i> <span class="smcap">Former Poor Man</span> <i>bursts into the room. He
is panting, as though he had been running. He is haggard and seems

Oh, I can't stand it much longer. It's driving me wild, I tell you. I do
wish the Judge would come.</p>

<p>I<small>MP</small>. [<i>Getting up from his chair and keeping step with the</i> <span class="smcap">Former Poor

be merry.</p>

<p>F<small>ORMER</small> P<small>OOR</small> M<small>AN</small>. [<i>Frantically waving his arms.</i>] Eat, drink, and be
merry be&mdash;&mdash;! Everything I eat gives me indigestion something awful;
everything I drink gives it to me worse. How can I be merry when I am in
this torment all the time? I tell you this pain is driving me mad. I
want to get rid of it quick. Oh, why doesn't the Judge come?</p>

<p>I<small>MP</small>. What's the Judge got to do with it?</p>

<p>F<small>ORMER</small> P<small>OOR</small> M<small>AN</small>. [<i>Pathetically.</i>] I am going to beg him to take back

<p class="cb">PERCY MACKAYE</p>

<p>Percy Mackaye, who was born in New York City in 1875, is one of the few
Americans whose interest has been almost wholly in the theatre. As a
lecturer, writer, and champion of real art in drama, he has had few if
any equals. He inherited his interest in drama from his father, Steele
Mackaye, author of <i>Hazel Kirke</i>. He was educated at Harvard, where he
studied under Professor George Pierce Baker, and at Leipzig. He has
travelled extensively in Europe and at various times has resided in
Rome, Switzerland, and London. In 1914 Dartmouth conferred upon him the
honorary Master of Arts degree. At present he holds a fellowship in
dramatic literature in Miami University, Oxford, Ohio.</p>

<p>Mr. Mackaye's efforts in the dramatic field have been varied. Masques,
pageants, operas, and plays are to his credit. <i>The Canterbury
Pilgrims</i>, <i>The Scarecrow</i>, <i>Jeanne D'Arc</i>, <i>Mater</i>, <i>Anti-Matrimony</i>,
<i>Sanctuary</i>, <i>Saint Louis Masque</i>, and <i>Caliban</i> are among his
better-known works.</p>

<p>In 1912 appeared his Yankee Fantasies, of which <i>Sam Average</i> and
<i>Gettysburg</i> are the more noteworthy.</p>

<p>In all of Mr. Mackaye's work he possesses what many dramatists lack&mdash;a
definite ideal. He aims at an artistic and literary effect. His <i>Sam
Average</i> is a real contribution to American patriotic drama.<a name="page_088" id="page_088"></a></p>

<p class="r">[<i>A pause again.</i></p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. [<i>To himself.</i>] Living!<a name="page_090" id="page_090"></a></p>

<p>J<small>OEL</small>. [<i>Sauntering over left, listens.</i>] Hear a rooster crow?</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. No. What are you doing?</p>

<p>J<small>OEL</small>. Tiltin' the flag over crooked in the dirt. That's our signal.</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. Nothing could be more appropriate, unless we buried it&mdash;buried
it in the dirt!</p>

<p>J<small>OEL</small>. She's to find us where the flag's turned down. I fixed that with
the sergeant all right. The rooster crowin' 's <i>her</i> watchword for us.</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. An eagle screaming, Joel: that would have been better.
[<i>Rising.</i>] Ah!</p>

<p class="r"> [<i>He laughs painfully.</i></p>

<p>J<small>OEL</small>. Hush up, Andy! The nearest men ain't two rods away. You'll wake
'em. Pitch it low.</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. Don't be alarmed. I'm coward enough.</p>

<p>J<small>OEL</small>. 'Course, though, there ain't much danger. I'm sentinel this end,
and the sergeant has the tip at t'other. Besides, you may call it the
reg'lar thing. There's been two thousand deserters already in this
tuppenny-ha'penny war, and none on 'em the worse off. When a man don't
get his pay for nine months&mdash;well, he ups and takes his vacation. Why
not? When Nell joins us, we'll hike up the Niagara, cross over to
Tonawanda, and take our breakfast in Buffalo. By that time the boys here
will be marchin' away toward Lundy's Lane.</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. [<i>Walks back and forth, shivering.</i>] I'm afraid.</p>

<p>J<small>OEL</small>. 'Fraid? Bosh!</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. I'm afraid to face&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>J<small>OEL</small>. Face what? We won't get caught.</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. Your sister&mdash;my wife.</p>

<p>J<small>OEL</small>. Nell! Why, ain't she comin' here just a-purpose to get you? Ain't
there reason enough, Lord knows? Ain't you made up your mind to light
out home anyhow?</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. Yes. That's just what she'll never forgive me for. In her heart
she'll never think of me the same. For she knows as well as I what
pledge I'll be breaking&mdash;what sacred pledge.<a name="page_091" id="page_091"></a></p>

<p>J<small>OEL</small>. What you mean?</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. No matter, no matter; this is gush.</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. You're better?</p>

<p>E<small>LLEN</small>. Let's forget&mdash;just for now.</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. Is he grown much?</p>

<p>E<small>LLEN</small>. Grown? You should see him! But so ill! What could I do? You
see&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. I know, I know.</p>

<p>E<small>LLEN</small>. The money was all gone. They turned me out at the old place, and
then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. I know, dear.</p>

<p>E<small>LLEN</small>. I got sewing, but when the smallpox&mdash;&mdash;<a name="page_092" id="page_092"></a></p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. I have all your letters, Nell. Come, help me to pack.</p>

<p>E<small>LLEN</small>. What! You're really decided&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>J<small>OEL</small>. [<i>Approaching.</i>] Hello, Sis!</p>

<p>E<small>LLEN</small>. [<i>Absently.</i>] Ah, Joel; that you? [<i>Eagerly, following</i> <span class="smcap">Andrew</span>
<i>to the knapsack</i>.] But, my dear&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. Just these few things, and we're off.</p>

<p>E<small>LLEN</small>. [<i>Agitated.</i>] Wait, wait! You don't know yet why I've
come&mdash;instead of writing.</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. I can guess.</p>

<p>E<small>LLEN</small>. But you can't; that's&mdash;what's so hard! I have to tell you
something, and then&mdash;&mdash; [<i>Slowly.</i>] I must know from your own eyes, from
yourself, that you wish to do this, Andrew; that you think it is
<i>right</i>.</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. [<i>Gently.</i>] I guessed that.</p>

<p>E<small>LLEN</small>. This is what I must tell you. It's not just the sickness, it's
not only the baby, not the money gone&mdash;and all that; it's&mdash;it's&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. [<i>Murmurs.</i>] My God!</p>

<p>E<small>LLEN</small>. It's what all that brings&mdash;the helplessness. I've been insulted.
Andy&mdash;[<i>Her voice breaks.</i>] I want a protector.</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. [<i>Taking her in his arms, where she sobs.</i>] There, dear!</p>

<p>E<small>LLEN</small>. [<i>With a low moan.</i>] You know.</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. I know. Come, now; we'll go.</p>

<p>E<small>LLEN</small>. [<i>Her face lighting up.</i>] Oh! and you <i>dare</i>! It's <i>right</i>?</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. [<i>Moving from her, with a hoarse laugh.</i>] <i>Dare?</i> Dare I be
damned by God and all his angels? Ha! Come, we're slow.</p>

<p>J<small>OEL</small>. Time enough.</p>

<p>E<small>LLEN</small>. [<i>Sinking upon</i> <span class="smcap">Joel's</span> <i>knapsack as a seat, leans her head on her
hands, and looks strangely at</i> <span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.] I'd better have written, I'm
afraid.<a name="page_093" id="page_093"></a></p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. [<i>Controlling his emotion.</i>] Now, don't take it that way. I've
considered it all.</p>

<p>E<small>LLEN</small>. [<i>With deep quiet.</i>] Blasphemously?</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. Reasonably, my brave wife. When I enlisted, I did so in a dream.
I dreamed I was called to love and serve our country. But that dream is
shattered. This sordid war, this political murder, has not one single
principle of humanity to excuse its bloody sacrilege. It doesn't deserve
my loyalty&mdash;our loyalty.</p>

<p>E<small>LLEN</small>. Are you saying this&mdash;for my sake? What of "God and his angels"?</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. [<i>Not looking at her.</i>] If we had a just cause&mdash;a cause of
liberty like that in Seventy-six; if to serve one's country meant to
serve God and his angels&mdash;then, yes; a man might put away wife and
child. He might say: "I will not be a husband, a father; I will be a
patriot." But now&mdash;like this&mdash;tangled in a web of spiders&mdash;caught in a
grab-net of politicians&mdash;and you, you and our baby-boy, like this&mdash;hell
let in on our home&mdash;no, Country be cursed!</p>

<p>E<small>LLEN</small>. [<i>Slowly.</i>] So, then, when little Andy grows up&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. [<i>Groaning.</i>] I say that the only thing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>E<small>LLEN</small>. I am to tell him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. [<i>Defiantly.</i>] Tell him his father deserted his country, and
thanked God for the chance. [<i>Looking about him passionately.</i>] Here!
[<i>He tears a part of the flag from its standard, and reaches it toward
her.</i>] You're cold; put this round you.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>As he is putting the strip of colored silk about her shoulders,
there rises, faint yet close by, a sound of fifes and flutes,
playing the merry march-strains of "Yankee Doodle."</i></p>

enveloped in a great cloak, a tall</i> <span class="smcap">Figure</span>, <i>which pauses beside
the standard of the torn flag, silhouetted against the first pale

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. [<i>Listening.</i>] Who are they? Where is it?</p>

<p>J<small>OEL</small>. [<i>Starts, alertly.</i>] He hears something.</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. Why should they play before daybreak?</p>

experience, sir. I can't quite see your face, yet you appear to be one
who has had a great deal of experience.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> F<small>IGURE</small>. Why, consid'able some.</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. Did you&mdash;happen to fight in the late war for independence?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> F<small>IGURE</small>. Happen to? [<i>Laughing quietly.</i>] N-no, not fight; ye see&mdash;I
was paymaster.</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. But you went through the war?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> F<small>IGURE</small>. Ye-es, oh, yes; I went through it. I took out my fust
reg'lar papers down to Philadelphie, in '76, seems like 'twas the fourth
day o' July. But I was paymaster afore that.</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. Tell me: I've heard it said there were deserters even in those
days, even from the roll-call of Washington. Is it true?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> F<small>IGURE</small>. True, boy? Have ye ever watched a prairie-fire rollin'
toward ye, billowin' with flame and smoke, and seed all the midget
cowerin' prairie-dogs scootin' for their holes? Wall, that's the way I
watched Howe's army sweepin' crosst the Jarsey marshes, and seed the
desartin' little patriots, with their chins over their shoulders,
skedaddlin' home'ards.</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. What&mdash;the Americans!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> F<small>IGURE</small>. All but a handful on 'em&mdash;them as weren't canines, ye might
say, but men. <i>They</i> set a back-fire goin' at Valley Forge. Most on 'em
burnt their toes and fingers off, lightin' on't thar in the white frost,
but they stuck it through and saved&mdash;wall, the prairie-dogs.</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. But they&mdash;those others. What reason did they give to God and
their own souls for deserting?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> F<small>IGURE</small>. To who?<a name="page_098" id="page_098"></a></p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. To their consciences. What was their reason? It must have been a
noble one in '76. <i>Their</i> reason <i>then</i>; don't you see, I must have it.
I must know what reason real heroes gave for their acts. You were there.
You can tell me.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> F<small>IGURE</small>. <i>Real</i> heroes, eh? Look around ye, then. To-day's the heroic
age, and the true brand o' hero is al'ays in the market. Look around ye!</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. What, here&mdash;in this war of jobsters, this petty campaign of
monstrous boodle?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> F<small>IGURE</small>. Thar we be!</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. Why, here are only a lot of cowardly half-men, like me&mdash;lovers
of their own folks&mdash;their wives and babies at home. They'll make
sacrifices for them. But real men like our fathers in '76: they looked
in the beautiful face of Liberty, and sacrificed to <i>her</i>!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> F<small>IGURE</small>. Our fathers, my boy, was jest as fond o' poetry as you be.
They talked about the beautiful face o' Liberty same's you; but when the
hom'made eyes and cheeks of their sweethearts and young uns took to
cryin', they desarted their beautiful goddess and skun out hom'.</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. But there were some&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> F<small>IGURE</small>. Thar was some as didn't&mdash;yes; and thar's some as don't
to-day. Those be the folks on my pay-roll. Why, look a-here: I calc'late
I wouldn't fetch much on the beauty counter. My talk ain't rhyme stuff,
nor the Muse o' Grammar wa'n't my schoolma'am. Th' ain't painter nor
clay-sculptor would pictur' me jest like I stand. For the axe has hewed
me, and the plough has furrered; and the arnin' of gold by my own
elbow-grease has give' me the shrewd eye at a bargain. I manure my crops
this side o' Jordan, and as for t'other shore, I'd ruther swap jokes
with the Lord than listen to his sarmons. And yet for the likes o' me,
jest for to arn my wages&mdash;ha, the many, many boys and gals that's gone
to their grave-beds, and when I a-closed their eyes, the love-light was
shinin' thar.<a name="page_099" id="page_099"></a></p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. [<i>Who has listened with awe.</i>] What <i>are</i> you? What <i>are</i> you?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> F<small>IGURE</small>. Me? I'm the paymaster.</p>

<p>A<small>NDREW</small>. But they died for you&mdash;the others.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> F<small>IGURE</small>. No, 'twa'n't for me; 'twas for him as pays the wages; the

forests, strike me down; with engine and derrick and millstone, bind me
their slave. Some for a lust, some for a love, shall desert me. One and
one, for his own, shall fall away. Yet one and one and one shall return
to me for life; the deserter and the destroyer shall re-create me.

<p class="cb">LADY AUGUSTA GREGORY</p>

<p>Lady Augusta Gregory, one of the foremost figures in the Irish dramatic
movement, was born at Roxborough, County Galway, Ireland, in 1859. "She
was then a young woman," says one who has described her in her early
married life, "very earnest, who divided her hair in the middle and wore
it smooth on either side of a broad and handsome brow. Her eyes were
always full of questions.... In her drawing-room were to be met men of
assured reputation in literature and politics, and there was always the
best reading of the times upon her tables." Lady Gregory has devoted her
entire life to the cause of Irish literature. In 1911 she visited the
United States and at a dinner given to her by <i>The Outlook</i> in New York
City she said:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">"I will not cease from mental strife</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp; Or let the sword fall from my hand</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp; Till we have built Jerusalem</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp; In&mdash;Ireland's&mdash;fair and lovely land."</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Lady Gregory, with William Butler Yeats and John Millington Synge, has
been the very life of the Irish drama. The literary association of these
three has been highly fruitful. She helped to found the Irish National
Theatre Society, and for a number of years has been the managing force
of the celebrated Abbey Theatre in Dublin.</p>

<p>Lady Gregory's chief interest has been in peasant comedies and
folk-plays. Her <i>Spreading the News</i>, <i>Hyacinth Halvey</i>, <i>The Rising of
the Moon</i>, <i>The Workhouse Ward</i>, and <i>The Travelling Man</i> are well-known
contributions to contemporary drama.</p>

<p>It is a noteworthy fact that most of the plays of the Irish dramatic
movement are one-act plays. Much of Irish life lends itself admirably to
one-act treatment. <i>Hyacinth Halvey</i> is one of Lady Gregory's best
productions. This play contains a universal idea: reputation is in great
measure a matter of "a password or an emotion." Hyacinth, having a good
reputation thrust upon him, may do as he likes&mdash;his good name clings to
him notwithstanding.<a name="page_106" id="page_106"></a></p>

<p class="hang">SCENE: <i>Outside the post-office at the little town of Cloon.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Delane</span> <i>at post-office door</i>. <span class="smcap">Mr. Quirke</span> <i>sitting on a chair at

<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. There is the four-o'clock train, Mr. Quirke.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Is it now, Mrs. Delane, and I not long after rising? It
makes a man drowsy to be doing the half of his work in the night-time.
Going about the country, looking for little stags of sheep, striving to
knock a few shillings together. That contract for the soldiers gives me
a great deal to attend to.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. I suppose so. It's hard enough on myself to be down ready
for the mail-car in the morning, sorting letters in the half-dark. It's
often I haven't time to look who are the letters from&mdash;or the cards.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. It would be a pity you not to know any little news might be
knocking about. If you did not have information of what is going on, who
should have it? Was it you, ma'am, was telling me that the new
sub-sanitary inspector would be arriving to-day?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. To-day it is he is coming, and it's likely he was in that
train. There was a card about him to Sergeant Carden this morning.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. A young chap from Carrow they were saying he was.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. So he is, one Hyacinth Halvey; and indeed if<a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a> all that is
said of him is true, or if a quarter of it is true, he will be a credit
to this town.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Is that so?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Testimonials he has by the score. To Father Gregan they
were sent. Registered they were coming and going. Would you believe me
telling you that they weighed up to three pounds?</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. There must be great bulk in them indeed.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. It is no wonder he to get the job. He must have a great
character, so many persons to write for him as what there did.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. It would be a great thing to have a character like that.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Indeed, I am thinking it will be long before you will get
the like of it, Fardy Farrell.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. If I had the like of that of a character it is not here carrying
messages I would be. It's in Noonan's Hotel I would be, driving cars.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Here is the priest's housekeeper coming.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. So she is; and there is the sergeant a little while after
her.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Joyce</span>.</p></div>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Good evening to you, Miss Joyce. What way is his reverence
to-day? Did he get any ease from the cough?</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. He did not, indeed, Mrs. Delane. He has it sticking to him
yet. Smothering he is in the night-time. The most thing he comes short
in is the voice.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. I am sorry, now, to hear that. He should mind himself well.</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. It's easy to say let him mind himself. What do you say to
him going to the meeting to-night?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Sergeant</span> <i>comes in</i>.</p></div>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. It's for his reverence's "Freeman" I am come, Mrs. Delane.<a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a></p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Here it is ready. I was just throwing an eye on it to see
was there any news. Good evening, Sergeant.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. [<i>Holding up a placard.</i>] I brought this notice, Mrs. Delane,
the announcement of the meeting to be held to-night in the court-house.
You might put it up here convenient to the window. I hope you are coming
to it yourself?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. I will come, and welcome. I would do more than that for
you, Sergeant.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. And you, Mr. Quirke.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. I'll come, to be sure. I forget what's this the meeting is
about.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. The Department of Agriculture is sending round a lecturer in
furtherance of the moral development of the rural classes. [<i>Reads.</i>] "A
lecture will be given this evening in Cloon Court-House, illustrated by
magic-lantern slides&mdash;" Those will not be in it; I am informed they were
all broken in the first journey, the railway company taking them to be
eggs. The subject of the lecture is "The Building of Character."</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Very nice, indeed, I knew a girl lost her character, and
she washed her feet in a blessed well after, and it dried up on the
minute.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. The arrangements have all been left to me, the archdeacon
being away. He knows I have a good intellect for things of the sort. But
the loss of those slides puts a man out. The thing people will not see
it is not likely it is the thing they will believe. I saw what they call
tableaux&mdash;standing pictures, you know&mdash;one time in Dundrum&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Miss Joyce was saying Father Gregan is supporting you.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. I am accepting his assistance. No bigotry about me when there
is a question of the welfare of any fellow creatures. Orange and green
will stand together to-night, I, myself, and the station-master on the
one side, your parish priest in the chair.<a name="page_110" id="page_110"></a></p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. If his reverence would mind me he would not quit the house
to-night. He is no more fit to go speak at a meeting than [<i>pointing to
the one hanging outside</i> <span class="smcap">Quirke's</span> <i>door</i>] that sheep.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. I am willing to take the responsibility. He will have no
speaking to do at all, unless it might be to bid them give the lecturer
a hearing. The loss of those slides now is a great annoyance to me&mdash;and
no time for anything. The lecturer will be coming by the next train.</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. Who is this coming up the street, Mrs. Delane?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. I wouldn't doubt it to be the new sub-sanitary inspector.
Was I telling you of the weight of the testimonials he got, Miss Joyce?</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. Sure, I heard the curate reading them to his reverence. He
must be a wonder for principles.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Indeed, it is what I was saying to myself, he must be a
very saintly young man.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Hyacinth Halvey</span>. <i>He carries a small bag and a large
brown-paper parcel. He stops and nods bashfully.</i></p></div>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. Good evening to you. I was bid to come to the post-office&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. I suppose you are Hyacinth Halvey? I had a letter about you
from the resident magistrate.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I heard he was writing. It was my mother got a friend he deals
with to ask him.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. He gives you a very high character.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. It is very kind of him, indeed, and he not knowing me at all.
But, indeed, all the neighbors were very friendly. Anything any one
could do to help me they did it.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. I'll engage it is the testimonials you have in your parcel?
I know the wrapping-paper, but they grew in bulk since I handled them.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. Indeed, I was getting them to the last. There<a name="page_111" id="page_111"></a> was not one
refused me. It is what my mother was saying, a good character is no
burden.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. I would believe that, indeed.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. Let us have a look at the testimonials.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Hyacinth Halvey</span> <i>opens a parcel, and a large number of envelopes
fall out</i>.</p></div>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. [<i>Opening and reading one by one.</i>] "He possesses the fire of
the Gael, the strength of the Norman, the vigor of the Dane, the
stolidity of the Saxon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. It was the chairman of the Poor Law Guardians wrote that.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. "A magnificent example to old and young&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. That was the secretary of the De Wet Hurling Club&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. "A shining example of the value conferred by an eminently
careful and high-class education&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. That was the national schoolmaster.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. "Devoted to the highest ideals of his motherland to such an
extent as is compatible with a hitherto non-parliamentary career&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. That was the member for Carrow.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. "A splendid exponent of the purity of the race&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. The editor of the "Carrow Champion."</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. "Admirably adapted for the efficient discharge of all possible
duties that may in future be laid upon him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. The new station-master.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. "A champion of every cause that can legitimately benefit his
fellow creatures&mdash;" Why, look here, my man, you are the very one to come
to our assistance to-night.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I would be glad to do that. What way can I do it?</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. You are a newcomer&mdash;your example would carry weight&mdash;you must
stand up as a living proof of the beneficial<a name="page_112" id="page_112"></a> effect of a high
character, moral fibre, temperance&mdash;there is something about it here I
am sure&mdash;(<i>Looks.</i>) I am sure I saw "unparalleled temperance" in some
place&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. It was my mother's cousin wrote that&mdash;I am no drinker, but I
haven't the pledge taken&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. You might take it for the purpose.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. [<i>Eagerly.</i>] Here is an antitreating button. I was made a
present of it by one of my customers&mdash;I'll give it to you [<i>sticks it
in</i> <span class="smcap">Hyacinth's</span> <i>coat</i>] and welcome.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. That is it. You can wear the button on the platform&mdash;or a bit
of blue ribbon&mdash;hundreds will follow your example&mdash;I know the boys from
the Workhouse will&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I am in no way wishful to be an example&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. I will read extracts from the testimonials. "There he is," I
will say, "an example of one in early life who by his own unaided
efforts and his high character has obtained a profitable situation."
[<i>Slaps his side.</i>] I know what I'll do. I'll engage a few corner-boys
from Noonan's bar, just as they are, greasy and sodden, to stand in a
group&mdash;there will be the contrast&mdash;the sight will deter others from a
similar fate&mdash;that's the way to do a tableau&mdash;I knew I could turn out a
success.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I wouldn't like to be a contrast&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. [<i>Puts testimonials in his pocket.</i>] I will go now and engage
those lads&mdash;sixpence each, and well worth it&mdash;nothing like an example
for the rural classes.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Goes off</i>, <span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span> <i>feebly trying to detain him</i>.</p></div>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. A very nice man, indeed. A little high up in himself,
maybe. I'm not one that blames the police. Sure they have their own
bread to earn like every other one. And indeed it is often they will let
a thing pass.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. [<i>Gloomily.</i>] Sometimes they will, and more times they will
not.</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. And where will you be finding a lodging, Mr. Halvey?<a name="page_113" id="page_113"></a></p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I was going to ask that myself, ma'am. I don't know the town.</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. I know of a good lodging, but it is only a very good man
would be taken into it.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Sure there could be no objection there to Mr. Halvey. There
is no appearance on him but what is good, and the sergeant after taking
him up the way he is doing.</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. You will be near to the sergeant in the lodging I speak of.
The house is convenient to the barracks.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. [<i>Doubtfully.</i>] To the barracks?</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. Alongside of it, and the barrack-yard behind. And that's not
all. It is opposite to the priest's house.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. Opposite, is it?</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. A very respectable place, indeed, and a very clean room you
will get. I know it well. The curate can see into it from his window.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. Can he now?</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. There was a good many, I am thinking, went into that lodging and
left it after.</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. [<i>Sharply.</i>] It is a lodging you will never be let into or
let stop in, Fardy. If they did go they were a good riddance.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. John Hart, the plumber, left it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. If he did it was because he dared not pass the police coming
in, as he used, with a rabbit he was after snaring in his hand.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. The schoolmaster himself left it.</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. He needn't have left it if he hadn't taken to card-playing.
What way could you say your prayers, and shadows shuffling and dealing
before you on the blind?</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I think maybe I'd best look around a bit before I'll settle in
a lodging&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. Not at all. You won't be wanting to pull down the blind.<a name="page_114" id="page_114"></a></p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. It is not likely <i>you</i> will be snaring rabbits.</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. Or bringing in a bottle and taking an odd glass the way
James Kelly did.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Or writing threatening notices, and the police taking a
view of you from the rear.</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. Or going to roadside dances, or running after
good-for-nothing young girls&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I give you my word I'm not so harmless as you think.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Would you be putting a lie on these, Mr. Halvey? [<i>Touching
testimonials.</i>] I know well the way you will be spending the evenings,
writing letters to your relations&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. Learning O'Growney's exercises&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Sticking post-cards in an album for the convent bazaar.</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. Reading the "Catholic Young Man"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Playing the melodies on a melodeon&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. Looking at the pictures in the "Lives of the Saints." I'll
hurry on and engage the room for you.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. Wait. Wait a minute&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. No trouble at all. I told you it was just opposite.</p>

<p class="r">[<i>Goes.</i></p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. I suppose I must go up-stairs and ready myself for the
meeting. If it wasn't for the contract I have for the soldiers' barracks
and the sergeant's good word, I wouldn't go anear it.</p>

<p class="r"> [<i>Goes into shop.</i></p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. I should be making myself ready, too. I must be in good
time to see you being made an example of, Mr. Halvey. It is I, myself,
was the first to say it; you will be a credit to the town.</p>

<p class="r"> [<i>Goes.</i></p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. [<i>In a tone of agony.</i>] I wish I had never seen Cloon.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. What is on you?</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I wish I had never left Carrow. I wish I had<a name="page_115" id="page_115"></a> been drowned the
first day I thought of it, and I'd be better off.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. What is it ails you?</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I wouldn't for the best pound ever I had be in this place
to-day.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. I don't know what you are talking about.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. To have left Carrow, if it was a poor place, where I had my
comrades, and an odd spree, and a game of cards&mdash;and a coursing-match
coming on, and I promised a new greyhound from the city of Cork. I'll
die in this place, the way I am, I'll be too much closed in.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. Sure it mightn't be as bad as what you think.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. Will you tell me, I ask you, what way can I undo it?</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. What is it you are wanting to undo?</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. Will you tell me what way can I get rid of my character?</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. To get rid of it, is it?</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. That is what I said. Aren't you after hearing the great
character they are after putting on me?</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. That is a good thing to have.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. It is not. It's the worst in the world. If I hadn't it, I
wouldn't be like a prize marigold at a show, with every person praising
me.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. If I had it, I wouldn't be like a head in a barrel, with every
person making hits at me.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. If I hadn't it, I wouldn't be shoved into a room with all the
clergy watching me and the police in the back yard.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. If I had it, I wouldn't be but a message-carrier now, and a
clapper scaring birds in the summer-time.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. If I hadn't it, I wouldn't be wearing this button and brought
up for an example at the meeting.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. [<i>Whistles.</i>] Maybe you're not so, what those papers make you out
to be?<a name="page_116" id="page_116"></a></p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. How would I be what they make me out to be? Was there ever any
person of that sort since the world was a world, unless it might be
Saint Antony of Padua looking down from the chapel wall? If it is like
that I was, isn't it in Mount Melleray I would be, or with the friars at
Esker? Why would I be living in the world at all, or doing the world's
work?</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. [<i>Taking up parcel.</i>] Who would think, now, there would be so
much lies in a small place like Carrow?</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. It was my mother's cousin did it. He said I was not reared for
laboring&mdash;he gave me a new suit and bid me never to come back again. I
daren't go back to face him&mdash;the neighbors knew my mother had a long
family&mdash;bad luck to them the day they gave me these. [<i>Tears letters and
scatters them.</i>] I'm done with testimonials. They won't be here to bear
witness against me.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. The sergeant thought them to be great. Sure he has the samples of
them in his pocket. There's not one in the town but will know before
morning that you are the next thing to an earthly saint.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. [<i>Stamping.</i>] I'll stop their mouths. I'll show them I can be
a terror for badness. I'll do some injury. I'll commit some crime. The
first thing I'll do I'll go and get drunk. If I never did it before I'll
do it now. I'll get drunk&mdash;then I'll make an assault&mdash;I tell you I'd
think as little of taking a life as of blowing out a candle.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. If you get drunk you are done for. Sure that will be held up
after as an excuse for any breaking of the law.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I will break the law. Drunk or sober, I'll break it. I'll do
something that will have no excuse. What would you say is the worst
crime that any man can do?</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. I don't know. I heard the sergeant saying one time it was to
obstruct the police in the discharge of their duty&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. That won't do. It's a patriot I would be then, worse than
before, with my picture in the weeklies. It's a red<a name="page_117" id="page_117"></a> crime I must commit
that will make all respectable people quit minding me. What can I do?
Search your mind now.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. It's what I heard the old people saying there could be no worse
crime than to steal a sheep&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I'll steal a sheep&mdash;or a cow&mdash;or a horse&mdash;if that will leave
me the way I was before.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. It's maybe in jail it will leave you.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I don't care&mdash;I'll confess&mdash;I'll tell why I did it&mdash;I give you
my word I would as soon be picking oakum or breaking stones as to be
perched in the daylight the same as that bird, and all the town
chirruping to me or bidding me chirrup&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. There is reason in that, now.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. Help me, will you?</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. Well, if it is to steal a sheep you want, you haven't far to go.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. [<i>Looking around wildly.</i>] Where is it? I see no sheep.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. Look around you.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I see no living thing but that thrush&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. Did I say it was living? What is that hanging on Quirke's rack?</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. It's [<i>fingers it</i>] a sheep, sure enough&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. Well, what ails you that you can't bring it away?</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. It's a dead one&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. What matter if it is?</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. If it was living I could drive it before me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. You could. Is it to your own lodging you would drive it? Sure
every one would take it to be a pet you brought from Carrow.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I suppose they might.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. Miss Joyce sending in for news of it and it bleating behind the
bed.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. [<i>Distracted.</i>] Stop! stop!<a name="page_118" id="page_118"></a></p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. [<i>From upper window.</i>] Fardy! Are you there, Fardy Farrell?</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. I am, ma'am.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. [<i>From window.</i>] Look and tell me is that the telegraph I
hear ticking?</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. [<i>Looking in at door.</i>] It is, ma'am.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Then botheration to it, and I not dressed or undressed.
Wouldn't you say, now, it's to annoy me it is calling me down. I'm
coming! I'm coming!</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I'll do it! I'll do it!</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. [<i>Lifting the sheep on his back.</i>] I'll give you a hand with it.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. [<i>Goes a step or two and turns round.</i>] You told me no place
where I could hide it.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. You needn't go far. There is the church beyond at the side of the
square. Go round to the ditch behind the wall&mdash;there's nettles in it.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. That'll do.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. She's coming out&mdash;run! run!</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. [<i>Runs a step or two.</i>] It's slipping!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. It is. And it concerns yourself.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Myself, is it? What accusation can they be bringing against
me? I'm a peaceable man.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Wait till you hear.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Maybe they think I was in that moonlighting case&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. That is not it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. I was not in it&mdash;I was but in the neighboring field&mdash;cutting
up a dead cow, that those never had a hand in&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. You're out of it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. They had their faces blackened. There is no man can say I
recognized them.<a name="page_120" id="page_120"></a></p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. That's not what they're saying&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. I'll swear I did not hear their voices or know them if I did
hear them.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. I tell you it has nothing to do with that. It might be
better for you if it had.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. What is it, so?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. It is an order to the sergeant, bidding him immediately to
seize all suspicious meat in your house. There is an officer coming
down. There are complaints from the Shannon Fort Barracks.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. I'll engage it was that pork.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. What ailed it for them to find fault?</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. People are so hard to please nowadays, and I recommended
them to salt it.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. They had a right to have minded your advice.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. There was nothing on that pig at all but that it went mad on
poor O'Grady that owned it.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. So I heard, and went killing all before it.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Sure it's only in the brain madness can be. I heard the
doctor saying that.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. He should know.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. I give you my word I cut the head off it. I went to the loss
of it, throwing it to the eels in the river. If they had salted the
meat, as I advised them, what harm would it have done to any person on
earth?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. I hope no harm will come on poor Mrs. Quirke and the
family.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Maybe it wasn't that but some other thing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Here is Fardy. I must send the message to the sergeant.
Well, Mr. Quirke, I'm glad I had the time to give you a warning.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. I'm obliged to you, indeed. You were always very neighborly,
Mrs. Delane. Don't be too quick now sending<a name="page_121" id="page_121"></a> the message. There is just
one article I would like to put away out of the house before the
sergeant will come.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Fardy</span>.</p></div>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Here now, Fardy&mdash;that's not the way you're going to the
barracks. Any one would think you were scaring birds yet. Put on your
uniform.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Fardy</span> <i>goes into office</i>.</p></div>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. You have this message to bring to the sergeant of police.
Get your cap now; it's under the counter.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Fardy</span> <i>reappears, and she gives him telegram</i>.</p></div>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. I'll bring it to the station. It's there he was going.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. You will not, but to the barracks. It can wait for him
there.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Fardy</span> <i>goes off</i>. <span class="smcap">Mr. Quirke</span> <i>has appeared at door</i>.</p></div>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. It was indeed a very neighborly act, Mrs. Delane, and I'm
obliged to you. There is just <i>one</i> article to put out of the way. The
sergeant may look about him then and welcome. It's well I cleared the
premises on yesterday. A consignment to Birmingham I sent. The Lord be
praised, isn't England a terrible country, with all it consumes?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Indeed, you always treat the neighbors very decent, Mr.
Quirke, not asking them to buy from you.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Just one article. [<i>Turns to rack.</i>] That sheep I brought in
last night. It was for a charity, indeed, I bought it from the widow
woman at Kiltartan Cross. Where would the poor make a profit out of
their dead meat without me? Where now is it? Well, now, I could have
swore that that sheep was hanging there on the rack when I went in&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. You must have put it in some other place.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. [<i>Going in and searching and coming out.</i>] I did not; there
is no other place for me to put it. Is it gone blind I am, or is it not
in it, it is?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. It's not there now, anyway.<a name="page_122" id="page_122"></a></p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Didn't you take notice of it there, yourself, this morning?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. I have it in my mind that I did; but it's not there now.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. There was no one here could bring it away?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Is it me, myself, you suspect of taking it, James Quirke?</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Where is it at all? It is certain it was not of itself it
walked away. It was dead, and very dead, the time I bought it.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. I have a pleasant neighbor, indeed, that accuses me that I
took his sheep. I wonder, indeed, you to say a thing like that! I to
steal your sheep or your rack or anything that belongs to you or to your
trade! Thank you, James Quirke. I am much obliged to you, indeed.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Ah, be quiet, woman; be quiet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. And let me tell you, James Quirke, that I would sooner
starve and see every one belonging to me starve than to eat the size of
a thimble of any joint that ever was on your rack or that ever will be
on it, whatever the soldiers may eat that have no other thing to get, or
the English, that devour all sorts, or the poor ravenous people that's
down by the sea!</p>

<p class="r">[<i>She turns to go into shop.</i></p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. [<i>Stopping her.</i>] Don't be talking foolishness, woman. Who
said you took my meat? Give heed to me now. There must some other
message have come. The sergeant must have got some other message.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. [<i>Sulkily.</i>] If there is any way for a message to come that
is quicker than to come by the wires, tell me what it is, and I'll be
obliged to you.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. The sergeant was up here, making an excuse he was sticking
up that notice. What was he doing here, I ask you?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. How would I know what brought him?<a name="page_123" id="page_123"></a></p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. It is what he did; he made as if to go away&mdash;he turned back
again and I shaving&mdash;he brought away the sheep&mdash;he will have it for
evidence against me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. [<i>Interested.</i>] That might be so.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. I would sooner it to have been any other beast nearly ever I
had upon the rack.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Is that so?</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. I bade the Widow Early to kill it a fortnight ago&mdash;but she
would not, she was that covetous!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. What was on it?</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. How would I know what was on it? Whatever was on it, it was
the will of God put it upon it&mdash;wasted it was, and shivering and
refusing its share.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. The poor thing.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Gone all to nothing&mdash;wore away like a flock of thread. It
did not weigh as much as a lamb of two months.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. It is likely the inspector will bring it to Dublin?</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. The ribs of it streaky with the dint of patent medicines&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. I wonder is it to the Petty Sessions you'll be brought or
is it to the Assizes?</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. I'll speak up to them. I'll make my defense. What can the
army expect at fippence a pound?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. It is likely there will be no bail allowed?</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Would they be wanting me to give them good quality meat out
of my own pocket? Is it to encourage them to fight the poor Indians and
Africans they would have me? It's the Anti-Enlisting Societies should
pay the fine for me.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. It's not a fine will be put on you, I'm afraid. It's five
years in jail you will be apt to be getting. Well, I'll try and be a
good neighbor to poor Mrs. Quirke.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Mr. Quirke</span>, <i>who has been stamping up and down, sits<a name="page_124" id="page_124"></a> down and

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Hadn't I heart-scalding enough before, striving to rear five
weak children?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. I suppose they will be sent to the Industrial Schools?</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. My poor wife&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. And she out in an ass-car at this minute, helping me to
follow my trade.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. I hope they will not arrest her along with you.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. I'll give myself up to justice. I'll plead guilty! I'll be
recommended to mercy!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. It might be best for you.</p>

family through the bringing away of one sheep!</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. [<i>Coming forward.</i>] Let you make yourself easy.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Easy! It's easy to say let you make yourself easy.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I can tell you where it is.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Where what is?</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. The sheep you are fretting after.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. What do you know about it?</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I know everything about it.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. I suppose the sergeant told you?</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. He told me nothing.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. I suppose the whole town knows it, so?</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. No one knows it, as yet.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. And the sergeant didn't see it?</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. No one saw it or brought it away but myself.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Where did you put it at all?</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. In the ditch behind the church wall. In among <a name="page_125" id="page_125"></a>the nettles it
is. Look at the way they have me stung.</p>

<p class="r"> [<i>Holds out hands.</i></p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. In the ditch! The best hiding-place in the town.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I never thought it would bring such great trouble upon you.
You can't say, anyway, I did not tell you.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. You, yourself, that brought it away and that hid it! I
suppose it was coming in the train you got information about the message
to the police.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. What now do you say to me?</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Say! I say I am as glad to hear what you said as if it was
the Lord telling me I'd be in heaven this minute.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. What are you going to do to me?</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Do, is it? [<i>Grasps his hand.</i>] Any earthly thing you would
wish me to do, I will do it.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I suppose you will tell&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Tell! It's I that will tell when all is quiet. It is I will

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. From the magistrates!</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. [<i>Shouting.</i>] I tell you I took the sheep&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. You did, God reward you!</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I stole away with it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. The blessing of the poor on you!</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I may as well say nothing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Let you be quiet now, Quirke. Here's the sergeant coming to
search the shop&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Sergeant</span> <i>comes in</i>. <span class="smcap">Quirke</span> <i>leaves go of</i> <span class="smcap">Halvey</span>, <i>who arranges

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. The department to blazes!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. What is it is putting you out?</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. To go to the train to meet the lecturer, and there to get a
message through the guard that he was unavoidably detained in the South,
holding an inquest on the remains of a drake.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. The lecturer, is it?</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. To be sure. What else would I be talking of? The lecturer has
failed me, and where am I to go looking for a person that I would think
fitting to take his place?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. And that's all? And you didn't get any message but the one?</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. Is that all? I am surprised at you, Mrs. Delane. Isn't it
enough to upset a man, within three-quarters of an hour of the time of
the meeting? Where, I would ask you, am I to find a man that has
education enough and wit enough and character enough to put up speaking
on the platform on the minute?</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. [<i>Jumps up.</i>] It is I, myself, will tell you that.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. You!</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. [<i>Slapping</i> <span class="smcap">Halvey</span> <i>on the back</i>.] Look at here, Sergeant.
There is not one word was said in all those papers about this young man
before you but it is true. And there could be no good thing said of him
that would be too good for him.<a name="page_127" id="page_127"></a></p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. It might not be a bad idea.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Whatever the paper said about him, Sergeant, I can say more
again. It has come to my knowledge&mdash;by chance&mdash;that since he came to
this town that young man has saved a whole family from destruction.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. That is much to his credit&mdash;helping the rural classes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. A family and a long family, big and little, like sods of
turf&mdash;and they depending on a&mdash;on one that might be on his way to dark
trouble at this minute if it was not for his assistance. Believe me, he
is the most sensible man, and the wittiest, and the kindest, and the
best helper of the poor that ever stood before you in this square. Is
not that so, Mrs. Delane?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. It is true, indeed. Where he gets his wisdom and his wit
and his information from I don't know, unless it might be that he is
gifted from above.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>.. Well, Mrs. Delane, I think we have settled that question. Mr.
Halvey, you will be the speaker at the meeting. The lecturer sent these
notes&mdash;you can lengthen them into a speech. You can call to the people
of Cloon to stand out, to begin the building of their character. I saw a
lecturer do it one time at Dundrum. "Come up here," he said; "Dare to be
a Daniel," he said&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I can't&mdash;I won't&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. [<i>Looking at papers and thrusting them into his hand.</i>] You
will find it quite easy. I will conduct you to the platform&mdash;these
papers before you and a glass of water&mdash;that's settled. [<i>Turns to go.</i>]
Follow me on to the court-house in half an hour&mdash;I must go to the
barracks first&mdash;I heard there was a telegram&mdash;[<i>Calls back as he goes.</i>]
Don't be late, Mrs. Delane. Mind, Quirke, you promised to come.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Well, it's time for me to make an end of settling
myself&mdash;and, indeed, Mr. Quirke, you'd best do the same.<a name="page_128" id="page_128"></a></p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. [<i>Rubbing his cheek.</i>] I suppose so. I had best keep on good
terms with him for the present. [<i>Turns.</i>] Well, now, I had a great
escape this day.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Both go in as</i> <span class="smcap">Fardy</span> <i>reappears, whistling</i>.</p></div>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. [<i>Sitting down.</i>] I don't know in the world what has come upon
the world that the half of the people of it should be cracked!</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. Weren't you found out yet?</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. Found out, is it? I don't know what you mean by being found
out.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. Didn't he miss the sheep?</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. He did, and I told him it was I took it&mdash;and what happened I
declare to goodness I don't know&mdash;Will you look at these?</p>

<p class="r"> [<i>Holds out
notes.</i></p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. Papers! Are they more testimonials?</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. They are what is worse. [<i>Gives a hoarse laugh.</i>] Will you
come and see me on the platform&mdash;these in my hand&mdash;and I
speaking&mdash;giving out advice. [<span class="smcap">Fardy</span> <i>whistles</i>.] Why didn't you tell me,
the time you advised me to steal a sheep, that in this town it would
qualify a man to go preaching, and the priest in the chair looking on?</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. The time I took a few apples that had fallen off a stall, they
did not ask me to hold a meeting. They welted me well.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. [<i>Looking round.</i>] I would take apples if I could see them. I
wish I had broke my neck before I left Carrow, and I'd be better off! I
wish I had got six months the time I was caught setting snares&mdash;I wish I
had robbed a church.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. Would a Protestant church do?</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I suppose it wouldn't be so great a sin.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. It's likely the sergeant would think worse of it. Anyway, if you
want to rob one, it's the Protestant church is the handiest.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. [<i>Getting up.</i>] Show me what way to do it?<a name="page_129" id="page_129"></a></p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. [<i>Pointing.</i>] I was going around it a few minutes ago, to see
might there be e'er a dog scenting the sheep, and I noticed the window
being out.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. Out, out and out?</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. It was, where they are putting colored glass in it for the
distiller&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. What good does that do me?</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. Every good. You could go in by that window if you had some person
to give you a hoist. Whatever riches there is to get in it then, you'll
get them.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I don't want riches. I'll give you all I will find if you will
come and hoist me.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. Here is Miss Joyce coming to bring you to your lodging. Sure I
brought your bag to it, the time you were away with the sheep&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. Run! Run!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>They go off.</i> <i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Joyce</span>.</p></div>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. Are you here, Mrs. Delane? Where, can you tell me, is Mr.
Halvey?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. [<i>Coming out dressed.</i>] It's likely he is gone on to the
court-house. Did you hear he is to be in the chair and to make an
address to the meeting?</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. He is getting on fast. His reverence says he will be a good
help in the parish. Who would think, now, there would be such a godly
young man in a little place like Carrow!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sergeant</span> <i>in a hurry, with telegram</i>.</p></div>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. What time did this telegram arrive, Mrs. Delane?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. I couldn't be rightly sure, Sergeant. But sure it's marked
on it, unless the clock I have is gone wrong.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. It is marked on it. And I have the time I got it marked on my
own watch.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Well, now, I wonder none of the police would have followed
you with it from the barracks&mdash;and they with so little to do&mdash;&mdash;<a name="page_130" id="page_130"></a></p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. [<i>Looking in at</i> <span class="smcap">Quirke's</span> <i>shop</i>.] Well, I am sorry to do what
I have to do, but duty is duty.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He ransacks shop.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Delane</span> <i>looks on</i>. <span class="smcap">Mr. Quirke</span> <i>puts his
head out of window</i>.</p></div>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. What is that going on inside? [<i>No answer.</i>] Is there any
one inside, I ask? [<i>No answer.</i>] It must be that dog of Tannian's&mdash;wait
till I get at him.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. It is Sergeant Carden, Mr. Quirke. He would seem to be
looking for something&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Mr. Quirke</span> <i>appears in shop</i>. <span class="smcap">Sergeant</span> <i>comes out, makes another
dive, taking up sacks, etc.</i></p></div>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. I'm greatly afraid I am just out of meat, Sergeant&mdash;and I'm
sorry now to disoblige you, and you not being in the habit of dealing
with me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. I should think not, indeed.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Looking for a tender little bit of lamb, I suppose you are,
for Mrs. Carden and the youngsters?</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. I am not.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. If I had it now, I'd be proud to offer it to you, and make
no charge. I'll be killing a good kid to-morrow. Mrs Carden might fancy
a bit of it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. I have had orders to search your establishment for unwholesome
meat, and I am come here to do it.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. [<i>Sitting down with a smile.</i>] Is that so? Well, isn't it a
wonder the schemers does be in the world.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. It is not the first time there have been complaints.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. I suppose not. Well, it is on their own head it will fall at
the last!</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. I have found nothing so far.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. I suppose not, indeed. What is there you could find, and it
not in it?</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. Have you no meat at all upon the premises?</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. I have, indeed, a nice barrel of bacon.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. What way did it die?<a name="page_131" id="page_131"></a></p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. It would be hard for me to say that. American it is. How
would I know what way they do be killing the pigs out there? Machinery,
I suppose, they have&mdash;steam-hammers&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. Is there nothing else here at all?</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. I give you my word, there is no meat, living or dead, in
this place, but yourself and myself and that bird above in the cage.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. Well, I must tell the inspector I could find nothing. But mind
yourself for the future.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Thank you, Sergeant. I will do that.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Fardy</span>. <i>He stops short.</i></p></div>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. It was you delayed that message to me, I suppose? You'd best
mend your ways or I'll have something to say to you.</p>

<p class="r">[<i>Seizes and shakes him.</i></p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. That's the way every one does be faulting me.</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. [<i>Picking it up.</i>] A half-a-crown! Where, now, did you get
that much, Fardy?</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. Where did I get it, is it?</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. I'll engage it was in no honest way you got it.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. I picked it up in the street&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. If you did, why didn't you bring it to the sergeant or to
his reverence?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. And some poor person, maybe, being at the loss of it.</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. I'd best bring it to his reverence. Come with me, Fardy,
till he will question you about it.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. It was not altogether in the street I found it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. There, now! I knew you got it in no good way! Tell me, now.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. It was playing pitch and toss I won it&mdash;&mdash;<a name="page_132" id="page_132"></a></p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. And who would play for half-crowns with the like of you,
Fardy Farrell? Who was it, now?</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. It was&mdash;a stranger&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. Do you hear that? A stranger! Did you see e'er a stranger in
this town, Mrs. Delane, or Sergeant Carden, or Mr. Quirke?</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Not a one.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. There was no stranger here.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. There could not be one here without me knowing it.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. I tell you there was.</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. Come on, then, and tell who was he to his reverence.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. [<i>Taking other arm.</i>] Or to the bench.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. I did get it, I tell you, from a stranger.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. Where is he, so?</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. He's in some place&mdash;not far away.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. Bring me to him.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. He'll be coming here.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. Tell me the truth and it will be better for you.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. [<i>Weeping.</i>] Let me go and I will.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. [<i>Letting go.</i>] Now&mdash;who did you get it from?</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. From that young chap came to-day, Mr. Halvey.</p>

<p>A<small>LL</small>. Mr. Halvey!</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. [<i>Indignantly.</i>] What are you saying, you young ruffian,
you? Hyacinth Halvey to be playing pitch and toss with the like of you!</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. I didn't say that.</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. You did say it. You said it now.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Hyacinth Halvey! The best man that ever came into this town!</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. Well, what lies he has!</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. It's my belief the half-crown is a bad one. Maybe it's to
pass it off it was given to him. There were tinkers<a name="page_133" id="page_133"></a> in the town at the
time of the fair. Give it here to me. [<i>Bites it.</i>] No, indeed, it's
sound enough. Here, Sergeant, it's best for you take it. [<i>Gives it to</i>
<span class="smcap">Sergeant</span>, <i>who examines it</i>.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. Can it be? Can it be what I think it to be?</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. What is it? What do you take it to be?</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. It is, it is. I know it, I know this half-crown&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. That is a queer thing, now.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. I know it well. I have been handling it in the church for the
last twelvemonth&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Is that so?</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. It is the nest-egg half-crown we hand round in the
collection-plate every Sunday morning. I know it by the dint on the
Queen's temples and the crooked scratch under her nose.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. [<i>Examining it.</i>] So there is, too.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. This is a bad business. It has been stolen from the church.</p>

<p>A<small>LL</small>. Oh! Oh! Oh!</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. [<i>Seizing</i> <span class="smcap">Fardy</span>.] You have robbed the church!</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. [<i>Terrified.</i>] I tell you I never did!</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. I have the proof of it.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. Say what you like! I never put a foot in it!</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. How did you get this, so?</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. I suppose from the <i>stranger</i>?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. I suppose it was Hyacinth Halvey gave it to you, now?</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. It was so.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. I suppose it was he robbed the church?</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. [<i>Sobs.</i>] You will not believe me if I say it.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Oh! the young vagabond! Let me get at him!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Here he is himself now!</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span> <i>comes in</i>. <span class="smcap">Fardy</span> <i>releases himself and creeps behind him</i>.<a name="page_134" id="page_134"></a></p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. It is time you to come, Mr. Halvey, and shut the mouth of
this young schemer.</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> J<small>OYCE</small>. I would like you to hear what he says of you, Mr. Halvey.
Pitch and toss, he says.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Robbery, he says.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Robbery of a church.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. He has had a bad name long enough. Let him go to a reformatory
now.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. [<i>Clinging to</i> <span class="smcap">Hyacinth</span>.] Save me, save me! I'm a poor boy trying
to knock out a way of living; I'll be destroyed if I go to a
reformatory. [<i>Kneels and clings to</i> <span class="smcap">Hyacinth's</span> <i>knees</i>.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I'll save you easy enough.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. Don't let me be jailed!</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. I'll get no more chance in the world&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. Sure I'm trying to free you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. It will be tasked to me always.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. Be quiet, can't you?</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. Don't you desert me!</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. Will you be silent?</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. Take it on yourself.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I will if you'll let me.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. Tell them you did it.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I am going to do that.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. Tell them it was you got in at the window.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I will! I will!</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. Say it was you robbed the box.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I'll say it! I'll say it!</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. It being open!</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. Let me tell, let me tell.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. Of all that was in it.<a name="page_135" id="page_135"></a></p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I'll tell them that.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. And gave it to me.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. [<i>Putting hand on his mouth and dragging him up.</i>] Will you
stop and let me speak?</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. We can't be wasting time. Give him here to me.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I can't do that. He must be let alone.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. [<i>Seizing him.</i>] He'll be let alone in the lock-up.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. He must not be brought there.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. I'll let no man get him off.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I will get him off.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. You will not!</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I will.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. Do you think to buy him off?</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. I will buy him off with my own confession.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. And what will that be?</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. It was I robbed the church.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. That is likely indeed!</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. Let him go, and take me. I tell you I did it.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. It would take witnesses to prove that.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. [<i>Pointing to</i> <span class="smcap">Fardy</span>.] He will be witness.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. Oh, Mr. Halvey, I would not wish to do that. Get me off and I
will say nothing.</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. Sure you must. You will be put on oath in the court.</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. I will not! I will not! All the world knows I don't understand
the nature of an oath!</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. [<i>Coming forward.</i>] Is it blind ye all are?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. What are you talking about?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Say out what you have to say.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. A walking saint he is!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. D<small>ELANE</small>. Maybe so.</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. The preserver of the poor! Talk of the holy martyrs! They
are nothing at all to what he is! Will you look at him! To save that
poor boy he is going! To take the blame on himself he is going! To say
he, himself, did the robbery he is going! Before the magistrate he is
going! To jail he is going! Taking the blame on his own head! Putting
the sin on his own shoulders! Letting on to have done a robbery! Telling
a lie&mdash;that it may be forgiven him&mdash;to his own injury! Doing all that, I
tell you, to save the character of a miserable slack lad, that rose in
poverty.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Murmur of admiration from all.</i></p></div>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. Now, what do you say?</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. [<i>Pressing his hand.</i>] Mr. Halvey, you have given us all a
lesson. To please you, I will make no information against the boy,
[<i>Shakes him and helps him up.</i>] I will put back the half-crown in the
poor-box next Sunday. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Fardy</span>.] What have you to say to your
benefactor?</p>

<p>F<small>ARDY</small>. I'm obliged to you, Mr. Halvey. You behaved very decent to me,
very decent indeed. I'll never let a word be said against you if I live
to be a hundred years.</p>

<p>S<small>ERGEANT</small>. [<i>Wiping eyes with a blue handkerchief.</i>] I will tell it at
the meeting. It will be a great encouragement to them to build up their
character. I'll tell it to the priest and he taking the chair&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>H<small>YACINTH</small>. Oh, stop, will you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>R</small>. Q<small>UIRKE</small>. The chair. It's in the chair he, himself, should be. It's in
a chair we will put him now. It's to chair him through the streets we
will. Sure he'll be an example and a blessing to the whole of the town.

<h2>THE GAZING GLOBE<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor"><span style="font-size:50%;">[F]</span></a></h2>

<p class="hang">SCENE: <i>A soft cream-colored room, bare walled and unfurnished
except for dull-blue grass mats on the floor and brilliant
cushions. In the centre of rear wall is a great circular window
with a dais before it, so that it may be used as a doorway. A
gathered shade of soft blue silk covers the opening of the window.</i></p>

<p class="hang">PLACE: <i>An island in a southern sea.</i></p>

<p class="hang">TIME: <i>Not so long ago.</i></p>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The curtain rises on an empty stage.</i> <span class="smcap">Zama</span>, <i>an old servant woman
dressed in dull purples and grays, hurries in from the right. She
stops at centre stage and glances about searchingly, then calls in
a weazen voice.</i></p></div>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. Ohano&mdash;Ohano! Where do you be, child?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Listens, looks about, sees drawn shade at the rear, and sighs as
she goes to it and starts to raise it.</i></p>

<p>[<i>As the shade rolls out of sight we see through the open window a
bit of quaint cliff garden that overlooks a sea of green. The rocks
are higher on the left, near the window, where a purple-pink vine
in full blossom has started to climb. At the right the rocks slope
down to the sea. At centre, stone steps lead up to a slender stone
pedestal that holds a gazing globe, now a brilliant gold in the
late afternoon sunlight.</i> <span class="smcap">Ohano</span>, <i>with hands clasped round the
globe, is gazing at it. She is a woman of the early twenties,
beautiful and gowned in a flowing kimono-like robe of green with
embroideries of white and blue.</i></p></div>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. [<i>In a chiding, motherly way.</i>] Ohano, my child, you must not be
so much at that evil ball! How many times be I not telling you it is an
<i>enchanted</i> ball?</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. Yes, Zama, I hope it is enchanted. I've tried every other means
to gain the way to my heart's desire&mdash;and they've all failed me. The
story these islanders have woven round this gazing globe may be but a
myth&mdash;but if it shows me the way to my freedom, I shall not have looked
at it in vain.</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. Be you forgetting, child, 'tis said that evil ball shows only the
way to destruction!</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. Yes, these island people will create any myth, go any length, to
keep one thinking, living in their narrow way. You are destined for evil
if you try to follow the urge of your own heart&mdash;oh, yes, I know.</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. But <i>your</i> heart, child, should only be wanting the love of Nijo.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. Nijo&mdash;I am hoping that he will be big enough to help me&mdash;but my
lover has been away so long&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. But to-day he be coming back&mdash;I came to tell you I think I saw his
boat&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. Nijo's boat? Where?</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. It be near the edge of the island just where&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. Why didn't you tell me before?</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. I came to&mdash;but I be forgetting when I see you at that evil ball
again.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. [<i>All eagerness.</i>] Perhaps we can see him land&mdash;from here on the
rocks&mdash;come, Zama, I hear the sound of voices down near the sea&mdash;come!
[<i>They climb to the highest rock.</i>] Look, Zama, the boat is there!
Already there in the green water against the shore!</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. It do seem to be so.</p>

<p class="r">[<i>Peers toward right.</i></p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. And <i>there</i>&mdash;is Nijo!</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. Where, where, child?</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. There&mdash;see, he's just coming ashore&mdash;oh, Nijo!<a name="page_145" id="page_145"></a> And look, Zama,
look what the people crowding round him have done&mdash;look!</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. What? My poor eyes be yet uncertain. What do they be doing to your
lover?</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. They have put upon him the Robe of Flame&mdash;to greet him with the
highest honor of the island.</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. So they be. The robe they say the gods themselves did wear when
time did first begin. Nijo must come back a great warrior now&mdash;a great
warrior!</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. Oh, how wonderful to return from the wars like that! Zama, I want
to&mdash;I <i>must</i> go out into the world and do great things too, like Nijo.</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. Nijo be coming back, child. That do be enough. Look, what is it
that glitters so in the sun?</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. Why, they are giving something to my red god&mdash;something that's
long as a serpent moon&mdash;see, he holds it out in admiration, before him.
Just what can it be?</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. In faith I do believe they have given your hero&mdash;a sword!</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. A marvellous sword&mdash;look, its jewels flash with the shifting
lights, warm as the colored rifts of sunset!</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. Such gems do be a tribute to his greatness, Ohano, they do.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. How gladly would I have the way I seek without such tribute&mdash;how
willingly!</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. And now the crowd do be parting&mdash;he leaves the boat and he looks
this way, Ohano&mdash;he looks!</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. Nijo, my red wonder of the world!</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. See, he mounts his steed&mdash;he waves to you!</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. Nijo! Nijo!</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. And now he rides off to come to you here. It is better we be
waiting inside for him&mdash;when he brings back his love to his promised
bride.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. [<i>As they enter room.</i>] Ah, Zama, he must bring me<a name="page_146" id="page_146"></a> more than
love this time&mdash;much more. Yes, your little Ohano must have more in her
life to-day than just love&mdash;and Nijo must show her the way to that realm
where she may stretch her soul and <i>live</i>!</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. The love of so great a man do be enough for any woman, child.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. Oh, no&mdash;oh, no&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. But it do be; and evil will fall, I know, if you do be asking more
than love!</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. But I tell you, Nijo's love is not enough. I must have a bigger,
greater thing!</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. The gods do know of none that be more than love.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. But there must be, else why would I feel the rush of its pulse
within my veins? Why would my whole being cry out for action and the
glory of doing big things in the lands across the sea? Why, tell me why,
I would feel those things if they were not so?</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. It be not for me to say, child; but I do be thinking you moon at
that evil ball too much. It do make your sight grow red! It be not wise
to know an enchanted thing so well.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. If that gazing globe in the garden would only show me the way to
my heart's desire, how gladly would I be the victim of its enchantment!</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. Nijo's kiss do be your enchantment, child. One touch of his lips
and you do be forgetting all else.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. If Nijo's kiss can make me forget this fever within me, I want
his kiss as I shall never want anything else in all of this life. I want
it!!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Approaching horse's hoofs are heard from off right.</i></p></div>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. Listen&mdash;the horse! Ohano, your lover do be coming!</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. [<i>Running to the window.</i>] Already? He must have taken the short
way through the cliffs.</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. Ah, child, do you not be excited as a bird in a storm-wind's
blow?<a name="page_147" id="page_147"></a></p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. [<i>Superbly, as she leans against window.</i>] Yes, I await my hero!</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. He's stopped, child! He do be here! At last he comes back to my
little Ohano!</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. My hope comes! [<i>With outstretched arms to right.</i>] My Nijo!!
Oh&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She had impulsively started to greet</i> <span class="smcap">Nijo</span>, <i>but suddenly shrinks
back</i>.</p></div>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. What do be wrong&mdash;what?</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. He's so different&mdash;so changed&mdash;oh, here he is&mdash;ssh!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Nijo</span> <i>appears at the window, where he pauses for a moment. He is a
tall, brunette man, scarcely thirty&mdash;a handsome, well-knit southern
island type, wearing a flowing robe of flame, with a flaring collar
of old-gold brocade. A peaked hat completes the costume. A curved
sword, with a hilt thickly studded with large jewels and incased in
gold, hangs at his belt. He seems worldly weary and sad as he
advances into the room.</i></p></div>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. Nijo!</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. [<i>Unimpassioned.</i>] Ohano.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. [<i>Eagerly.</i>] You have come back!</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. Yes&mdash;and the season of the heat has been gracious to your health,
I hope?</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. Yes&mdash;and yours, Nijo?</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. The same.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. Oh, I am glad&mdash;glad as tree-blossoms for the kiss of spring. And
Zama here shares my welcome, don't you?</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. [<i>Recognizing</i> <span class="smcap">Zama</span>.] Ah, Zama.</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. [<i>Bowing before him.</i>] The gods do be kind to bring back a hero to
us.</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. Now I do be going for refreshments for your weariness; <a name="page_148" id="page_148"></a>great it
must be after so long a voyage.</p>

<p class="r"> [<i>Exits right.</i></p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. Shall we not sit here?</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. As you will.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Ohano</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Nijo</span> <i>sit upon mats near the window, partly facing
each other</i>.</p></div>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. They&mdash;they gave you a sword at the boat.</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. [<i>Wearily.</i>] Oh, yes.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. Even from up here we could see its jewels flash.</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. [<i>Without interest.</i>] Yes, it is cunningly conceived.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. How wonderful it must be. Perhaps&mdash;I may see it?</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. [<i>Still wearily.</i>] If you so desire.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Unbuckles sword and holds it before himself for her to examine.
She leans over it admiringly, touching the jewels as she speaks of
them.</i></p></div>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. Magnificent! Rubies and emeralds and sapphires! And here are
moonstones and diamonds. How you must prize it.</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. [<i>Wearily.</i>] Of course, one must.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. And the very people who tried to stop you from going across the
sea to win your glory have given it to you.</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. That is the way of the world.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. Show me the way to glory, Nijo.</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. And why?</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. I would travel it too.</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. You&mdash;a simple island maiden?</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. I'm not simple. I've grown beyond the people here.</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. But there is glory in the work women must do at home.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. And I have done my share of it. I want bigger work now&mdash;out in
the world.</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. But the simple tasks must be done.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. I am sick unto death of doing them!</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. But you can't go into the battles of the world. You are an island
woman.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. This last war has made all women free. If the other island women
cling to the everlasting tradition that woman should not go beyond her
native hearth, let them cling. I shall<a name="page_149" id="page_149"></a> reach the summit of things and
know the glory of doing big things in the world!</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. But you&mdash;sheltered, protected all your life&mdash;how can you do it?</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. That's what troubles me. But you were fettered by this island
life and you broke through the bars of convention. How did <i>you</i> do it?</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. [<i>Sadly.</i>] Ohano, I would not spoil your life by telling you.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. Spoil it? What do you think is happening to it now? Oh, Nijo,
can't you understand I'm stagnating&mdash;<i>dying</i> in this commonplace island
life.</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. I thought that about myself, too, when I started my climb to
glory; but scarcely a moon had passed before I realized the loneliness
of great heights.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. [<i>Tigerishly.</i>] Are you trying to turn me from my wish&mdash;to have
all the island's glory for yourself?</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. No, but only the valley people enjoy the sublimity of a mountain.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. [<i>Scornfully.</i>] Ha!</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. Those who reach the top have lost their perspective. All they see
are the lonely tops of other mountains.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. [<i>Sublimely.</i>] But they've had the joy of the climb!</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. And worth what&mdash;no more than the mist of the sea.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. Do you think that satisfies me? I want to find out for myself! I
only want you to tell me the way to use this spirit that boils within my
blood, thirsts for action!</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. That I never will.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. Oh, what shall I do? I've even implored the sun and the moon!
[<i>Looks toward sea.</i>] Now I <i>must</i> listen to my dreams&mdash;my dreams that
cry and cry: "Look in the gazing globe! Look in the gazing globe! It
will show you the way!" And if it ever does, I'll take that path <i>no
matter where it leads</i>.</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. My journey only made me want to come back to the<a name="page_150" id="page_150"></a> haven of your
love, Ohano. The amber cup of glory left me athirst to be wrapped in the
mantle of your boundless love and warmed with the glow of your heart.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. [<i>Surprised.</i>] Your journey has really led you back to me?</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. [<i>Sadly.</i>] You're my only hope. I've been as mad for you as the
sea for the moonlight.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. [<i>Disturbed.</i>] But you had fire and impulse when you went away;
and now&mdash;well, you do still yearn for me?</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. [<i>Quietly, without passion.</i>] The hope for your love has been the
light of my brain, changing from life to dream, from earth to star.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. My thirst for glory has been that way; but Zama tells me it is as
nothing in the kiss of love. If love has that power, I am willing to
forget all else. Kiss me, Nijo!</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. At last my lips will press yours, as the sun flames to an immortal
moment when it meets the sky.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Kneeling opposite each other, their lips meet.</i> <span class="smcap">Ohano</span> <i>instantly
gives a piercing scream and recoils from him</i>. <span class="smcap">Nijo</span> <i>sinks into a
heap</i>.</p></div>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. [<i>Rising and turning toward the sea, weeping.</i>] Oh, oh, oh!</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. [<i>Rushing in from right.</i>] What is it? What is it, Ohano?</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. [<i>Still weeping.</i>] Oh&mdash;ooh.</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. What do it be, my little Ohano?</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. [<i>Turning.</i>] His kiss&mdash;Nijo's kiss!</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. Yes?</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. Cold as white marble&mdash;<i>cold</i>!</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. Cold as white marble?</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. Oh, Nijo, why do you kiss me like a thing of stone?</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. [<i>As he looks up, pitifully.</i>] Into that kiss I tried to put all
the love I've thought these many years.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. The love you've <i>thought</i>?<a name="page_151" id="page_151"></a></p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. [<i>Despondently.</i>] Yes, I've only thought it&mdash;<i>thought</i> it!</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. But your heart&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. [<i>Rising.</i>] My heart feels no more! Only my head thinks.</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. You love no more?</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. Only with my head, it seems. I see things, know things, understand
things; but I no longer feel anything. And my thirst for glory has done
it all&mdash;killed my love of life and turned my very kiss to stone. Oh,
glory, why do men give the essence of their lives to you&mdash;you who last
no longer than the glow of gold above the place of sunset!</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. [<i>Superbly.</i>] Because glory gives you the world&mdash;everything!</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. It takes everything away&mdash;strips you&mdash;and leaves you nothing to
believe. Oh, I could have become a common soldier here, marching
shoulder to shoulder with the island men going out to war&mdash;but no&mdash;I
must be a great warrior, a hero in position. Had I known then what I
know now, how gladly would I have gone as one of the thousands who are
known as&mdash;just soldiers. They are the ones who know the throb of life
and love!</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. You bring back such a message to me? You who have climbed and
climbed to heights till I have believed you to be as constant in your
quest as the light that shines upon the gazing globe?</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. I&mdash;a light?</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. Why not? I've always likened your feet unto the disks of two
luminaries, lighting the way for all the world to follow. [<i>Looks at
gazing globe, which is now a ball of gold against the black sea and
sky.</i>] And now you tell me I was wrong. Perhaps the light upon the
gazing globe itself is the only one to follow.</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. I&mdash;a light? Why, Ohano, if I'm anything, I'm a gazing globe!</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. What do you mean&mdash;you a gazing globe?<a name="page_152" id="page_152"></a></p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. That without I'm all fair, all wonderful&mdash;but within I'm empty as
a gazing globe.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. [<i>Scornfully.</i>] But a gazing globe shows men the way to their
heart's desire.</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. It reflects to men what they see into it. So does glory.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. I can't believe that&mdash;now.</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. Behold what it has done to me! Already as a child I gazed at that
globe, longing to grasp the glory of which it was a symbol. It filled me
with a red madness, surged with an unbearable music, giving me a riotous
pain! Oh, it made me drunk for the wine of glory!</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. I know! I know! Now you talk as the man I thought you were.</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. I'm not a man. I'm dead.</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. But you have known the glory of life. Shall I never know the way
to it? [<i>Appealingly, to the globe.</i>] The way&mdash;the way is what I seek!</p>

<p>Z<small>AMA</small>. Look not so upon the evil ball, child. It do be enchanted for one
thousand years! [<span class="smcap">Ohano</span> <i>moves nearer the globe</i>.] Go not so near, child!
Evil will fall&mdash;and you will be enslaved!</p>

<p>O<small>HANO</small>. What care I, if it shows me the way?</p>

<p class="r">[<i>Hands outstretched to the

within its enchanted grasp. And it do be an enchanted ball!</p>

<p>N<small>IJO</small>. Perhaps there's more to its enchantment than I thought. It claimed
me for a victim&mdash;and now it's freezing her life's warmth to the

<p class="cb">ANTON TCHEKOV</p>

<p>Anton Tchekov, considered the foremost of contemporary Russian
dramatists, was born in 1860 at Taganrog, Russia. In 1880 he was
graduated from the Medical School of the University of Moscow. Ill
health soon compelled him to abandon his practice of medicine, and in
1887 he sought the south. In 1904, the year of the successful appearance
of his <i>Cherry Orchard</i>, he died in a village of the Black Forest in
Germany.</p>

<p>As a dramatist, Tchekov has with deliberate intent cast off much of the
conventionalities of dramatic technic. In his longer plays especially,
like <i>The Sea Gull</i>, <i>Uncle Vanya</i>, and <i>Cherry Orchard</i>, he somewhat
avoids obvious struggles, time-worn commonplaces, well-prepared
climaxes, and seeks rather to spread out a panoramic canvas for our
contemplation. His chief aim is to show us humanity as he sees it. It is
his interest in humanity that gives him so high rank as a dramatist.</p>

<p>His one-act plays, a form of drama unusually apt for certain intimate
aspects of Russian peasant life, are more regular in their technic than
his longer plays. Among the five or six shorter plays that Tchekov
wrote, <i>The Boor</i> and <i>A Marriage Proposal</i> are his best. In these plays
he shows the lighter side of Russian country life, infusing some of the
spirit of the great Gogol into his broad and somewhat farcical character
portrayals. With rare good grace, in these plays he appears to be asking
us to throw aside our restraint and laugh with him at the stupidity and
naïveté, as well as good-heartedness, of the Russian people he knew so
well.</p>

<p><i>The Boor</i> is a remarkably well-constructed one-act play, and is
probably the finest one-act play of the Russian school of drama.<a name="page_158" id="page_158"></a></p>

</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. It isn't right, ma'am. You're wearing yourself out! The maid and
the cook have gone looking for berries; everything that breathes is
enjoying life; even the cat knows how to be happy&mdash;slips about the
courtyard and catches birds&mdash;but you hide yourself here in the house as
though you were in a cloister. Yes, truly, by actual reckoning you
haven't left this house for a whole year.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. And I shall never leave it&mdash;why should I? My life is over.
He lies in his grave, and I have buried myself within these four walls.
We are both dead.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. There you are again! It's too awful to listen to, so it is!
Nikolai Michailovitch is dead; it was the will of the Lord, and the Lord
has given him eternal peace. You have grieved over it and that ought to
be enough. Now it's time to stop. One can't weep and wear mourning
forever! My wife died a few years ago. I grieved for her. I wept a whole
month&mdash;and then it was over. Must one be forever singing lamentations?
That would be more than your husband was worth! [<i>He sighs.</i>] You have
forgotten all your neighbors. You don't go out and you receive no one.
We live&mdash;you'll pardon me&mdash;like the spiders, and the good light of day
we never see. All the livery is eaten by the mice&mdash;as though there
weren't any more nice people in the world! But the whole neighborhood is
full of<a name="page_160" id="page_160"></a> gentlefolk. The regiment is stationed in
Riblov&mdash;officers&mdash;simply beautiful! One can't see enough of them! Every
Friday a ball, and military music every day. Oh, my dear, dear ma'am,
young and pretty as you are, if you'd only let your spirits live&mdash;!
Beauty can't last forever. When ten short years are over, you'll be glad
enough to go out a bit and meet the officers&mdash;and then it'll be too
late.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. [<i>Resolutely.</i>] Please don't speak of these things again.
You know very well that since the death of Nikolai Michailovitch my life
is absolutely nothing to me. You think I live, but it only seems so. Do
you understand? Oh, that his departed soul may see how I love him! I
know, it's no secret to you; he was often unjust toward me, cruel,
and&mdash;he wasn't faithful, but I shall be faithful to the grave and prove
to him how <i>I</i> can love. There, in the Beyond, he'll find me the same as
I was until his death.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. What is the use of all these words, when you'd so much rather go
walking in the garden or order Tobby or Welikan harnessed to the trap,
and visit the neighbors?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. [<i>Weeping.</i>] Oh!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Madam, dear madam, what is it? In Heaven's name!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. He loved Tobby so! He always drove him to the Kortschagins
or the Vlassovs. What a wonderful horse-man he was! How fine he looked
when he pulled at the reins with all his might! Tobby, Tobby&mdash;give him
an extra measure of oats to-day!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Yes, ma'am.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>A bell rings loudly.</i></p></div>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. [<i>Shudders.</i>] What's that? I am at home to no one.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Yes, ma'am. [<i>He goes out, centre.</i></p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. [<i>Gazing at the photograph.</i>] You shall see, Nikolai, how I
can love and forgive! My love will die only with me<a name="page_161" id="page_161"></a>&mdash;when my poor heart
stops beating. [<i>She smiles through her tears.</i>] And aren't you ashamed?
I have been a good, true wife; I have imprisoned myself and I shall
remain true until death, and you&mdash;you&mdash;you're not ashamed of yourself,
my dear monster! You quarrelled with me, left me alone for weeks&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Luka</span> <i>enters in great excitement</i>.</p></div>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Oh, ma'am, some one is asking for you, insists on seeing you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. You told him that since my husband's death I receive no one?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. I said so, but he won't listen; he says it is a pressing matter.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. I receive no one!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. I told him that, but he's a wild man; he swore and pushed himself
into the room; he's in the dining-room now.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. [<i>Excitedly.</i>] Good. Show him in. The impudent&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Luka</span> <i>goes out, centre</i>.</p></div>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. What a bore people are! What can they want with me? Why do
they disturb my peace? [<i>She sighs.</i>] Yes, it is clear I must enter a
convent. [<i>Meditatively.</i>] Yes, a convent.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Smirnov</span> <i>enters, followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Luka</span>.</p></div>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. [To <span class="smcap">Luka.</span>] Fool, you make too much noise! You're an ass!
[<i>Discovering</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Popov</span>&mdash;<i>politely</i>.] Madam, I have the honor to
introduce myself: Lieutenant in the Artillery, retired, country
gentleman, Grigori Stepanovitch Smirnov! I'm compelled to bother you
about an exceedingly important matter.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. [<i>Without offering her hand.</i>] What is it you wish?</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. Your deceased husband, with whom I had the honor to be
acquainted, left me two notes amounting to about twelve hundred roubles.
Inasmuch as I have to pay the interest<a name="page_162" id="page_162"></a> to-morrow on a loan from the
Agrarian Bank, I should like to request, madam, that you pay me the
money to-day.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. Twelve hundred&mdash;and for what was my husband indebted to you?</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. He bought oats from me.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. [<i>With a sigh, to</i> <span class="smcap">Luka</span>.] Don't forget to give Tobby an
extra measure of oats.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Luka</span> <i>goes out</i>.</p></div>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Smirnov</span>.] If Nikolai Michailovitch is indebted to you,
I shall, of course, pay you, but I am sorry, I haven't the money to-day.
To-morrow my manager will return from the city and I shall notify him to
pay you what is due you, but until then I cannot satisfy your request.
Furthermore, to-day it is just seven months since the death of my
husband, and I am not in a mood to discuss money matters.</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. And I am in the mood to fly up the chimney with my feet in the
air if I can't lay hands on that interest to-morrow. They'll seize my
estate!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. Day after to-morrow you will receive the money.</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. I don't need the money day after to-morrow; I need it to-day.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. I'm sorry I can't pay you to-day.</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. And I can't wait until day after to-morrow.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. But what can I do if I haven't it?</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. So you can't pay?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. I cannot.</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. Hm! Is that your last word?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. My last.</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. Absolutely?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. Absolutely.</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. Thank you. [<i>He shrugs his shoulders.</i>] And they expect me to
stand for all that. The toll-gatherer just now met me in the road and
asked me why I was always worrying.<a name="page_163" id="page_163"></a> Why, in Heaven's name, shouldn't I
worry? I need money, I feel the knife at my throat. Yesterday morning I
left my house in the early dawn and called on all my debtors. If even
one of them had paid his debt! I worked the skin off my fingers! The
devil knows in what sort of Jew-inn I slept; in a room with a barrel of
brandy! And now at last I come here, seventy versts from home, hope for
a little money, and all you give me is moods! Why shouldn't I worry?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. I thought I made it plain to you that my manager will return
from town, and then you will get your money.</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. I did not come to see the manager; I came to see you. What the
devil&mdash;pardon the language&mdash;do I care for your manager?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. Really, sir, I am not used to such language or such manners.
I shan't listen to you any further.</p>

<p class="r">[<i>She goes out, left.</i></p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. What can one say to that? Moods! Seven months since her husband
died! Do I have to pay the interest or not? I repeat the question, have
I to pay the interest or not? The husband is dead and all that; the
manager is&mdash;the devil with him!&mdash;travelling somewhere. Now, tell me,
what am I to do? Shall I run away from my creditors in a balloon? Or
knock my head against a stone wall? If I call on Grusdev he chooses to
be "not at home," Iroschevitch has simply hidden himself, I have
quarrelled with Kurzin and came near throwing him out of the window,
Masutov is ill and this woman has&mdash;moods! Not one of them will pay up!
And all because I've spoiled them, because I'm an old whiner, dish-rag!
I'm too tender-hearted with them. But wait! I allow nobody to play
tricks with me, the devil with 'em all! I'll stay here and not budge
until she pays! Brr! How angry I am, how terribly angry I am! Every
tendon is trembling with anger, and I can hardly breathe! I'm even
growing ill! [<i>He calls out.</i>] Servant!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Luka</span> <i>enters</i>.</p></div>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. What is it you wish?</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. Bring me Kvas or water! [<span class="smcap">Luka</span> <i>goes out</i>.] Well, what can we
do? She hasn't it on hand? What sort of logic is that? A fellow stands
with the knife at his throat, he needs money, he is on the point of
hanging himself, and she won't pay because she isn't in the mood to
discuss money matters. Woman's logic! That's why I never liked to talk
to women, and why I dislike doing it now. I would rather sit on a powder
barrel than talk with a woman. Brr!&mdash;I'm getting cold as ice; this
affair has made me so angry. I need only to see such a romantic creature
from a distance to get so angry that I have cramps in the calves! It's
enough to make one yell for help!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Luka</span>.</p></div>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. March! [<span class="smcap">Luka</span> <i>goes out</i>.] Ill and isn't receiving! All right,
it isn't necessary. I won't receive, either! I'll sit here and stay
until you bring that money. If you're ill a week, I'll sit here a week.
If you're ill a year, I'll sit here a year. As Heaven is my witness,
I'll get the money. You don't disturb me with your mourning&mdash;or with
your dimples. We know these dimples! [<i>He calls out the window.</i>] Simon,
unharness! We aren't going to leave right away. I am going to stay here.
Tell them in the stable to give the horses some oats. The left horse has

Stop! [<i>Leaves window.</i>] It's awful. Unbearable heat, no money, didn't
sleep last night and now&mdash;mourning-dresses with moods. My head aches;
perhaps I ought to have a drink. Ye-s, I must have a drink. [<i>Calling.</i>]
Servant!</p>

dirty boots, unwashed, uncombed, straw on my vest&mdash;the lady probably
took me for a highwayman. [<i>He yawns.</i>] It was a little impolite to come
into a reception-room<a name="page_165" id="page_165"></a> with such clothes. Oh, well, no harm done. I'm
not here as a guest. I'm a creditor. And there is no special costume for
creditors.</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. Pay me my money and I'll leave.</p>

that I need the money, not day after to-morrow, but to-day. If you don't

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. I'm not talking about stables, I'm asking you whether I have to
pay that interest to-morrow or not?</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. Oh, yes, I have.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. No, you have not. You are an ill-bred, vulgar person!
Respectable people don't speak so to ladies.</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. How remarkable! How do you want one to speak to you? In French,
perhaps! Madame, je vous prie! Pardon me for having disturbed you. What
beautiful weather we are having to-day! And how this mourning becomes
you!</p>

<p class="r"> [<i>He makes a low bow with mock ceremony.</i></p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. Not at all funny! I think it vulgar!</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. [<i>Imitating her.</i>] Not at all funny&mdash;vulgar! I don't understand
how to behave in the company of ladies. Madam, in the course of my life
I have seen more women than you have sparrows. Three times have I fought
duels for women, twelve I jilted and nine jilted me. There was a time
when I played the fool, used honeyed language, bowed and scraped. I
loved, suffered, sighed to the moon, melted in love's torments. I loved
passionately, I loved to madness, loved in every key, chattered like a
magpie on emancipation, sacrificed half my fortune in the tender
passion, until now the devil knows I've had enough of it. Your obedient
servant will let you lead him around by the nose no more. Enough! Black
eyes, passionate eyes, coral lips, dimples in cheeks, moonlight
whispers, soft, modest sighs&mdash;for all that, madam, I wouldn't pay a
kopeck! I am not speaking of present company, but of women in general;
from the tiniest to the greatest, they are conceited, hypocritical,
chattering, odious, deceitful from top to toe; vain, petty, cruel with a
maddening logic and [<i>he strikes his forehead</i>] in this respect, please
excuse my frankness, but one sparrow is worth ten of the aforementioned
petticoat-philosophers. When one sees one of the romantic creatures
before him he imagines he is looking at some holy being, so wonderful
that its one breath could dissolve<a name="page_167" id="page_167"></a> him in a sea of a thousand charms
and delights; but if one looks into the soul&mdash;it's nothing but a common
crocodile. [<i>He seizes the arm-chair and breaks it in two.</i>] But the
worst of all is that this crocodile imagines it is a masterpiece of
creation, and that it has a monopoly on all the tender passions. May the
devil hang me upside down if there is anything to love about a woman!
When she is in love, all she knows is how to complain and shed tears. If
the man suffers and makes sacrifices she swings her train about and
tries to lead him by the nose. You have the misfortune to be a woman,
and naturally you know woman's nature; tell me on your honor, have you
ever in your life seen a woman who was really true and faithful? Never!
Only the old and the deformed are true and faithful. It's easier to find
a cat with horns or a white woodcock, than a faithful woman.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. But allow me to ask, who is true and faithful in love? The
man, perhaps?</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. Yes, indeed! The man!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. The man! [<i>She laughs sarcastically.</i>] The man true and
faithful in love! Well, that is something <i>new</i>! [<i>Bitterly.</i>] How can
you make such a statement? Men true and faithful! So long as we have
gone thus far, I may as well say that of all the men I have known, my
husband was the best; I loved him passionately with all my soul, as only
a young, sensible woman may love; I gave him my youth, my happiness, my
fortune, my life. I worshipped him like a heathen. And what happened?
This best of men betrayed me in every possible way. After his death I
found his desk filled with love-letters. While he was alive he left me
alone for months&mdash;it is horrible even to think about it&mdash;he made love to
other women in my very presence, he wasted my money and made fun of my
feelings&mdash;and in spite of everything I trusted him and was true to him.
And more than that: he is dead and I am still true to him. I have buried
myself within these four walls and I shall wear this mourning to my
grave.<a name="page_168" id="page_168"></a></p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. [<i>Laughing disrespectfully.</i>] Mourning! What on earth do you
take me for? As if I didn't know why you wore this black domino and why
you buried yourself within these four walls. Such a secret! So romantic!
Some knight will pass the castle, gaze up at the windows, and think to
himself: "Here dwells the mysterious Tamara who, for love of her
husband, has buried herself within four walls." Oh, I understand the
art!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. [<i>Springing up.</i>] What? What do you mean by saying such
things to me?</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. You have buried yourself alive, but meanwhile you have not
forgotten to powder your nose!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. How dare you speak so?</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. Don't scream at me, please; I'm not the manager. Allow me to
call things by their right names. I am not a woman, and I am accustomed
to speak out what I think. So please don't scream.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. I'm not screaming. It is you who are screaming. Please leave

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. [<i>Steps toward her quickly.</i>] Permit me to ask what right you

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. What of it? Do you think I am afraid of you?</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. And you think that because you are a romantic creature you can

you are a woman, one of the "weaker sex"!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. [<i>Trying to cry him down.</i>] Boor, boor, boor!</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. It is high time to do away with the old superstition<a name="page_170" id="page_170"></a> that it
is only the man who is forced to give satisfaction. If there is equity

bullet in your impudent head. The devil take you!</p>

<p class="r"> [<i>She goes out.</i></p>

go away. You have frightened me to death already, and now you want to
fight a duel.</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. [<i>Paying no attention.</i>] A duel. That's equity, emancipation.
That way the sexes are made equal. I'll shoot her down as a matter of
principle. What can a person say to such a woman? [<i>Imitating her.</i>]
"The devil take you. I'll put a bullet in your impudent head." What can
one say to that? She was angry, her eyes blazed, she accepted the
challenge. On my honor, it's the first time in my life that I ever saw
such a woman.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Oh, sir. Go away. Go away!</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. That <i>is</i> a woman. I can understand her. A real woman. No
shilly-shallying, but fire, powder, and noise! It would be a pity to
shoot a woman like that.</p>

<p class="r">[<i>He goes out.</i></p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. [<i>Looking at the pistols.</i>] You see, there are different kinds.
There are special duelling pistols, with cap and ball. But these are
revolvers, Smith &amp; Wesson, with ejectors; fine pistols! A pair like that
cost at least ninety roubles. This is the way to hold a revolver.
[<i>Aside.</i>] Those eyes, those eyes! A real woman!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. Like this?</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. Yes, that way. Then you pull the hammer back&mdash;so&mdash;then you
aim&mdash;put your head back a little. Just stretch your arm out, please.
So&mdash;then press your finger on the thing like that, and that is all. The
chief thing is this: don't get excited, don't hurry your aim, and take
care that your hand doesn't tremble.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. It isn't well to shoot inside; let's go into the garden.</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. Yes. I'll tell you now, I am going to shoot into the air.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. That is too much! Why?</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. Because&mdash;because. That's my business.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. You are afraid. Yes. A-h-h-h, No, no, my dear sir, no
flinching! Please follow me. I won't rest until I've made a hole in that

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. Yes, I'm afraid.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. You are lying. Why won't you fight?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. [<i>With an angry laugh.</i>] You like me! He dares to say he
likes me! [<i>She points to the door.</i>] Go.</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. [<i>Laying the revolver silently on the table, takes his hat and
starts. At the door he stops a moment, gazing at her silently, then he
approaches her, hesitating.</i>] Listen! Are you still angry? I was mad as
the devil, but please understand me&mdash;how can I express myself? The thing

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. Go, or I'll shoot.</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. Shoot! You have no idea what happiness it would be to die in
sight of those beautiful eyes, to die from the revolver in this little
velvet hand! I'm mad! Consider it and decide immediately, for if I go
now, we shall never see each other again. Decide&mdash;speak&mdash;- I am a noble,
a respectable man, have an income of ten thousand, can shoot a coin
thrown into the air. I own some fine horses. Will you be my wife?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. [<i>Swings the revolver angrily.</i>] I'll shoot!</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. My mind is not clear&mdash;I can't understand. Servant&mdash;water! I
have fallen in love like any young man. [<i>He takes her hand and she
cries with pain.</i>] I love you! [<i>He kneels.</i>] I love you as I have never
loved before. Twelve women I jilted, nine jilted me, but not one of them
all have I loved as I love you. I am conquered, lost; I lie at your feet
like a fool and beg for your hand. Shame and disgrace! For five years I
haven't been in love; I thanked the Lord for it, and now I am caught,
like a carriage tongue in another carriage. I beg for your hand! Yes or
no? Will you?&mdash;Good!</p>

<p>S<small>MIRNOV</small>. [<i>Stopping.</i>] Well?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. P<small>OPOV</small>. Nothing. You may go. But&mdash;wait a moment. No, go on, go on. I
hate you. Or&mdash;no; don't go. Oh, if you knew how angry I was, how angry!

this thing. [<i>She angrily tears her handkerchief.</i>] What are you

<p class="hang">SCENE: <i>The basement of a large apartment-house in New York City.</i></p>

<p class="hang">SCENE: <i>The kitchen of the Bauer flat in the basement of the Bryn
Mawr. A window at the side gives on an area and shows the walk
above and the houses across the street. Opposite the windows is a
door to an inner room. Through the outer door, in the centre of the
back wall, a dumb-waiter and whistles to tenants can be seen. A
broken milk-bottle lies in a puddle of milk on the cement floor in
front of the dumb-waiter. To the right of the outer door, a
telephone; gas-range on which there are flat-irons heating and
vegetables cooking. To the left of the outer door is an old
sideboard; over it hangs a picture of Schiller. Near the centre of
the room, a little to the right, stands a kitchen table with four
chairs around it. Ironing-board is placed between the kitchen table
and the sink, a basket of dampened clothes under it. A large
calendar on the wall. An alarm-clock on the window-sill. Time: a
little before noon. The telephone rings</i>; <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bauer</span> <i>leaves her

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He stands looking at her with growing sympathy.</i></p></div>

<p>L<small>ANE</small>. Nothin'. Got a rag 'round here? Dumb-waiter's all wet.... Lot of

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>AUER</small>. [<i>Without lifting her eyes, mechanically hands him a mop
which hangs beside the door.</i>] Here.</p>

<p>L<small>ANE</small>. What's the matter?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>AUER</small>. [<i>Dully.</i>] Huh?</p>

<p>L<small>ANE</small>. [<i>Significantly.</i>] Oh, I know.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>AUER</small>. What you know?</p>

<p>L<small>ANE</small>. About the boss. [<span class="smcap">Mrs. Bauer</span> <i>looks distressed</i>.] Heard your
friends across the street talkin'.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>AUER</small>. [<i>Bitterly.</i>] Friends!</p>

<p>L<small>ANE</small>. Rotten trick to play on the boss, all right, puttin' that old maid
up to get him pinched.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>AUER</small>. [<i>Absently.</i>] Was she an old maid?</p>

<p>L<small>ANE</small>. The cruelty-to-animals woman over there [<i>waves his
hand</i>]&mdash;regular old crank. Nies<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> put her up to it all right.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>AUER</small>. I guess it was his old woman. Nies ain't so bad. She's the
one. Because my two boys dress up a little on Sunday, she don't like it.</p>

<p>L<small>ANE</small>. Yes, she's sore because the boys told her the boss kicks their
dog.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>AUER</small>. He don't do nothin' of the sort&mdash;jus' drives it 'way from
the garbage-pails&mdash;that's all. We coulda had that dog took up long
ago&mdash;they ain't got no license. But Fritz&mdash;he's so easy&mdash;he jus' takes
it out chasin' the dog and hollerin'.</p>

<p>L<small>ANE</small>. That ain't no way. He ought to make the dog holler&mdash;good and
hard&mdash;once; then it'd keep out of here.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>AUER</small>. Don't you go to talkin' like that 'round my man. Look at all
this trouble we're in on account of a stray cat.</p>

<p>L<small>ANE</small>. I better get busy. They'll be callin' up the store in<a name="page_181" id="page_181"></a> a minute.
That woman's the limit.... Send up the groceries in that slop, she'd
send them down again. High-toned people like her ought to keep maids.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He mops out the lower shelf of the dumb-waiter, then looks at the
broken bottle and the puddle of milk inquiringly.</i></p></div>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>AUER</small>. [<i>Taking the mop away from him.</i>] I'll clean that up. I
forgot&mdash;in all this trouble.</p>

<p>L<small>ANE</small>. Whose milk?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>AUER</small>. The Mohlers'. That's how it all happened. Somebody upset
their milk on the dumb-waiter and the cat was on the shelf lickin' it
up; my man, not noticin', starts the waiter up and the cat tries to jump
out; the bottle rolls off and breaks. The cat was hurt awful&mdash;caught in
the shaft. I don't see how it coulda run after that, but it did&mdash;right
into the street, right into that woman&mdash;Fritz after it. Then it fell
over. "You did that?" she says to Fritz. "Yes," he says, "I did that."
He didn't say no more, jus' went off, and then after a while they came
for him and&mdash;&mdash; [<i>She begins to cry softly.</i></p>

<p>L<small>ANE</small>. Brace up; they ain't goin' to do anything to him.... [<i>Comes into
kitchen. Hesitatingly.</i>] Say!... He didn't kick the cat&mdash;did he?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>AUER</small>. Who said so?</p>

<p>L<small>ANE</small>. Mrs. Nies&mdash;says she saw him from her window.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>AUER</small>. [<i>As though to herself.</i>] I dunno. [<i>Excitedly.</i>] Of course
he didn't kick that cat. [<i>Again, as though to herself.</i>] Fritz is so
quick-tempered he mighta kicked it 'fore he knew what he was about. No
one'd ever know how good Fritz is unless they lived with him. He never
hurt no one and nothing except himself.</p>

<p>L<small>ANE</small>. Oh, I'm on to the boss. I never mind his hollerin'.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>AUER</small>. If you get a chance, bring me some butter for dinner&mdash;a
pound.</p>

<p>L<small>ANE</small>. All right. I'll run over with it in ten or fifteen minutes, soon
as I get rid of these orders out here in the wagon.<a name="page_182" id="page_182"></a></p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>AUER</small>. That'll do.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>AUER</small>. Those are Nies's boys.</p>

<p>L<small>ANE</small>. Regular toughs! Call the cop and have 'em pinched if they don't
stop it.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>AUER</small>. If my man hears them&mdash;you know&mdash;there'll be more trouble.</p>

<p>L<small>ANE</small>. The boss ought to make it hot for them.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>AUER</small>. Such trouble!</p>

<p>L<small>ANE</small>. [<i>Starts to go.</i>] Well&mdash;luck to the boss.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>AUER</small>. There ain't no such thing as luck for us.</p>

<p>L<small>ANE</small>. Aw, come on....</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>AUER</small>. Everything's against us. First Fritz's mother dies. We named
the baby after her&mdash;Trude.... Then we lost Trude. That finished Fritz.
After that he began this hollerin' business. And now this here
trouble&mdash;just when things was goin' half-ways decent for the first time.

<p>Alfred Kreymborg, one of the foremost advocates of free-verse rhythmical
drama, was born in New York City, 1883. He founded and edited <i>The
Globe</i> while it was in existence; and under its auspices issued the
first anthology of imagist verse (Ezra Pound's Collection, 1914). In
July, 1915, he founded <i>Others, a Magazine of the New Verse</i>, and <i>The
Other Players</i> in March, 1918, an organization devoted exclusively to
American plays in poetic form. At present Mr. Kreymborg is in Italy,
launching a new international magazine, <i>The Broom</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Kreymborg has been active in both poetry and drama. He has edited
several anthologies of free verse, and has published his own free verse
as <i>Mushrooms</i> and <i>The Blood of Things</i>. His volume of plays, all in
free rhythmical verse, is <i>Plays for Poem&mdash;Mimes</i>. The most popular
plays in this volume are <i>Lima Beans</i>, and <i>Manikin and Minikin</i>.</p>

<p><i>Manikin and Minikin</i> aptly exemplifies Mr. Kreymborg's idea of
rhythmical, pantomimic drama. It is a semi-puppet play in which there
are dancing automatons to an accompaniment of rhythmic lines in place of
music. Mr. Kreymborg is a skilled musician and he composes his lines
with musical rhythm in mind. His lines should be read accordingly.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Seen through an oval frame, one of the walls of a parlor. The
wall-paper is a conventionalized pattern. Only the shelf of the
mantelpiece shows. At each end, seated on pedestals turned slightly
away from one another, two aristocratic bisque figures, a boy in
delicate cerise and a girl in cornflower blue. Their shadows join
in a grotesque silhouette. In the centre, an ancient clock whose
tick acts as the metronome for the sound of their high voices.
Presently the mouths of the figures open and shut, after the mode
of ordinary conversation.</i></p>

<br />
<span class="smcap">She.</span> You say that so wisely&mdash;<br />
you're such a philosopher&mdash;<br />
say it again!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">He.</span> That which is able to move<br />
can never be steadfast, you understand?<a name="page_208" id="page_208"></a><br />
Let us consider the creature at hand<br />
to whom you have referred<br />
with an undue excess of admiration<br />
adulterated with an undue excess of envy&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">She.</span> Say that again!<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">He.</span> To begin with&mdash;<br />
I can only see part of her at once.<br />
She moves into my vision;<br />
she moves out of my vision;<br />
she is doomed to be wayward.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">She.</span> Yes, but that which you see of her&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">He.</span> Is ugly, commonplace, unsightly.<br />
Her face a rose-face?<br />
It's veined with blood and the skin of it wrinkles&mdash;<br />
her eyes are ever so near to a hen's&mdash;<br />
her movements,<br />
if one would pay such a gait with regard&mdash;<br />
her gait is unspeakably ungainly&mdash;<br />
her hair&mdash;&mdash;<br />

<span class="smcap">She.</span> Stay beautiful?</p>

<p class="hangg"><span class="smcap">He.</span> Humans change with each going moment.<br />
That is a gray-haired platitude.<br />
Just as I can see that creature<br />

at best, twice or thrice&mdash;<br />
you're more precious than when you came!</p>

<p class="hangg">

<p class="hangg">
<span class="smcap">He.</span> They have what philosophy terms moods,<br />

This may be true, I'm assured&mdash;<br />
as true as when <i>we</i> say, I love you.<br />
But they can only say,<br />
I love you,<br />
so long as the mood breathes,<a name="page_210" id="page_210"></a><br />
so long as the breezes blow,<br />
so long as water remains wet.<br />
They are honest&mdash;<br />
they mean what they say&mdash;<br />
passionately, tenaciously, tragically&mdash;<br />
but when the mood languishes,<br />
they have to say,<br />
if it be they are honest&mdash;<br />
I do not love you.<br />

<p>Paul Greene, one of the most promising of the University of North
Carolina Playmakers, was born in 1894 on a farm near Lillington, North
Carolina. He has received his education at Buies Creek Academy and at
the University of North Carolina, from which he received his bachelor's
degree in 1921. He saw service with the A. E. F. in France, with the
105th United States Engineers.</p>

<p>In addition to <i>White Dresses</i>, Mr. Greene has written a number of
one-act plays: <i>The Last of the Lowries</i> (to be included in a
forthcoming volume of Carolina Folk-Plays, published by Henry Holt &amp;
Company), <i>The Miser</i>, <i>The Old Man of Edenton</i>, <i>The Lord's Will</i>,
<i>Wreck P'int</i>, <i>Granny Boling</i> (in <i>The Drama</i> for August-September,
1921). The first three plays named above were produced originally by the
Carolina Playmakers at Chapel Hill.</p>

<p><i>White Dresses</i> is an excellent example of folk-play of North Carolina.
This play was written in English 31, the course in dramatic composition
at the University of North Carolina conducted by Professor Frederick H.
Koch. "The Aim of the Carolina Playmakers," says Professor Koch, "is to
build up a genuinely native drama, a fresh expression of the folk-life
in North Carolina, drawn from the rich background of local tradition and
from the vigorous new life of the present day. In these simple plays we
hope to contribute something of lasting value in the making of a new
folk-theatre and a new folk-literature."</p>

<p>Out of the many conflicts of American life, past and present, Mr. Greene
sees possibilities for a great native drama. <i>White Dresses</i> presents a
fundamental aspect of the race problem in America.<a name="page_218" id="page_218"></a></p>

<h2><a name="WHITE_DRESSES" id="WHITE_DRESSES"></a>WHITE DRESSES</h2>

<p class="hang">TIME: <i>The evening before Christmas, 1900</i>.</p>

<p class="hang">SCENE: <i>The scene is laid in a negro cabin, the home of</i> <span class="smcap">Candace</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mary Mclean</span>, <i>in eastern North Carolina</i>.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>In the right corner of the room is a rough bed covered with a
ragged counterpane. In the centre at the rear is an old bureau with
a cracked mirror, to the left of it a door opening to the outside.
In the left wall is a window with red curtains. A large chest
stands near the front on this side, and above it hang the family
clothes, several ragged dresses, an old bonnet, and a cape. At the
right, toward the front, is a fireplace, in which a small fire is
burning. Above and at the sides of the fireplace hang several pots
and pans, neatly arranged. Above these is a mantel, covered with a
lambrequin of dingy red crape paper. On the mantel are bottles and
a clock. A picture of "Daniel in the Lion's Den" hangs above the
mantel. The walls are covered with newspapers, to which are pinned
several illustrations clipped from popular magazines. A rough table
is in the centre of the room. A lamp without a chimney is on it.
Several chairs are about the room. A rocking-chair with a rag
pillow in it stands near the fire. There is an air of cleanliness
and poverty about the whole room.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>The rising of the curtain discloses the empty room. The fire is
burning dimly.</i> <span class="smcap">Aunt Candace</span> <i>enters at the rear, carrying several
sticks of firewood under one arm. She walks with a stick, and is
bent with rheumatism. She is dressed in a slat bonnet, which hides
her face in its shadow, brogan shoes, a<a name="page_220" id="page_220"></a> man's ragged coat, a
checkered apron, a dark-colored dress. She mumbles to herself and
shakes her head as she comes in. With great difficulty she puts the
wood on the fire, and then takes the poker and examines some
potatoes that are cooking in the ashes. She takes out her snuff-box
and puts snuff in her lip. As she does this her bonnet is pushed
back, and in the firelight her features are discernible&mdash;sunken
eyes, high cheek-bones, and big, flat nose. Upon her forehead she
wears a pair of steel-rimmed spectacles.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>She sits down in a rocking-chair, now and then putting her hand to
her head, and groaning as if in pain. She turns and looks
expectantly toward the door. After a moment she hobbles to the
chest on the right and takes out an old red crocheted fascinator.
Shivering she wraps it around her neck and stands looking down in
the chest. She lifts out a little black box and starts to unfasten
it, when the door suddenly opens and</i> <span class="smcap">Mary McLean</span> <i>comes in</i>. <span class="smcap">Aunt
Candace</span> <i>puts the box hastily back into the chest, and hurries to
the fire</i>.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Mary Mclean</span> <i>has a "turn" of collards in one arm and a paper bundle
in the other. She lays the collards on the floor near the window
and puts her shawl on the bed. She is a quadroon girl about
eighteen years old, with an oval face and a mass of fine dark hair,
neatly done up. There is something in her bearing that suggests a
sort of refinement. Her dress is pitifully shabby, her shoes
ragged. But even this cannot hide the lines of an almost perfect
figure. For a negro she is pretty. As she comes up to the fire her
pinched lips and the tired expression on her face are plainly

<p>Arthur Hopkins, one of the well-known men of the practical theatre of
to-day, was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1878. He completed his academic
training at Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio. At present he
is the manager of Plymouth Theatre, New York City.</p>

<p>Mr. Hopkins's entire life has been given to the theatre, which is his
hobby. In the midst of his various activities as a manager he has found
time to do some dramatic writing. Among his one-act plays are <i>Thunder
God</i>, <i>Broadway Love</i>, and <i>Moonshine</i>, which appeared in the <i>Theatre
Acts Magazine</i> for January, 1919.</p>

<p><i>Moonshine</i> is an excellent play of situation that has grown out of the
reaction of character on character.<a name="page_242" id="page_242"></a></p>

don't answer his likeness.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. Who's Jim Dunn?</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. You ought to know who Jim Dunn is. He's just about the worst one
of your revenue critters that ever hit these parts. He's got four of the
boys in jail. We got a little reception all ready for him. See that?</p>

<p class="r">[<i>Pointing to sketch on back wall.</i></p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. [<i>Looking at sketch.</i>] Yes.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. I'm sorry to disappoint you.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. [<i>Turning to cupboard and filling pipe.</i>] Oh, it's all right. I
reckon one Revenue's about as good as another, after all.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. Are you sure I'm a revenue officer?</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. [<i>Rising.</i>] Well, since we ketched ye climin' trees an' snoopin'
round the stills, I reckon we won't take no chances that you hain't.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. Oh.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Say, mebbe you'd like a seggar. Here's one I been savin' fer quite
a spell back, thinkin' mebbe I'd have company some day. [<i>Brings out
dried-up cigar, hands it to him.</i></p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. No, thank you.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. It hain't no luck to smoke alone when ye got company. [<i>Striking

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. [<i>After two puffs, makes wry face, throws cigar on table.</i>] You
make death very easy, Mister.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Luke's my name. Yer kin call me Luke. Make you feel as though you
had a friend near you at the end&mdash;Luke Hazy.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. [<i>Starting as though interested, rising.</i>] Not the Luke Hazy
that cleaned out the Crosby family?</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. [<i>Startled.</i>] How'd you hear about it?</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. Hear about it? Why, your name's been in every newspaper in the
United States. Every time you killed another Crosby the whole feud was
told all over again. Why, I've seen your picture in the papers twenty
times.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Hain't never had one took.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. That don't stop them from printing it. Don't you ever read the
newspapers?<a name="page_246" id="page_246"></a></p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Me read? I hain't read nothin' fer thirty years. Reckon I couldn't
read two lines in a hour.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. You've missed a lot of information about yourself.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. How many Crosbys did they say I killed?</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. I think the last report said you had just removed the twelfth.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. It's a lie! I only killed six ... that's all they wuz&mdash;growed up.
I'm a-waitin' fer one now that's only thirteen.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. When'll he be ripe?</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Jes as soon as he comes a-lookin' fer me.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. Will he come?</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. He'll come if he's a Crosby.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. A brave family?</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. They don't make 'em any braver&mdash;they'd be first-rate folks if they
wuzn't Crosbys.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. If you feel that way why did you start fighting them?</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. I never started no fight. My granddad had some misunderstandin'
with their granddad. I don't know jes what it wuz about, but I reckon my
granddad wuz right, and I'll see it through.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. You must think a lot of your grandfather.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Never seen 'im, but it ain't no luck goin' agin yer own kin. Won't
ye have a drink?</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. No&mdash;no&mdash;thank you.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Well, Mr. Revenue, I reckon we might as well have this over.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. What?</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Well, you won't get drunk, and I can't be put to the trouble o'
havin' somebody guard you.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. That'll not be necessary.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Oh, I know yer like this yer place now, but this evenin' you might
take it into yer head to walk out.<a name="page_247" id="page_247"></a></p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. I'll not walk out unless you make me.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Tain't like I'll let yer, but I wouldn't blame yer none if yu
tried.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. But I'll not.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. [<i>Rising.</i>] Say, Mistah Revenue, I wonder if you know what you're
up against?</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. What do you mean?</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. I mean I gotta kill you.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. [<i>Rising, pauses.</i>] Well, that lets me out.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. What do yu mean?</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. I mean that I've been trying to commit suicide for the last two
months, but I haven't had the nerve.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. [<i>Startled.</i>] Suicide?</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. Yes. Now that you're willing to kill me, the problem is solved.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Why, what d'ye want to commit suicide fer?</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. I just want to stop living, that's all.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Well, yu must have a reason.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. No special reason&mdash;I find life dull and I'd like to get out of
it.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Dull?</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. Yes&mdash;I hate to go to bed&mdash;I hate to get up&mdash;I don't care for
food&mdash;I can't drink liquor&mdash;I find people either malicious or dull&mdash;I
see by the fate of my acquaintances, both men and women, that love is a
farce. I have seen fame and preference come to those who least deserved
them, while the whole world kicked and cuffed the worthy ones. The
craftier schemer gets the most money and glory, while the fair-minded
dealer is humiliated in the bankruptcy court. In the name of the law
every crime is committed; in the name of religion every vice is
indulged; in the name of education greatest ignorance is rampant.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. I don't git all of that, but I reckon you're some put out.<a name="page_248" id="page_248"></a></p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. I am. The world's a failure ... what's more, it's a farce. I
don't like it but I can't change it, so I'm just aching for a chance to
get out of it.... [<i>Approaching</i> <span class="smcap">Luke</span>.] And you, my dear friend, are
going to present me the opportunity.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Yes, I reckon you'll get your wish now.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. Good ... if you only knew how I've tried to get killed.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Well, why didn't you kill yerself?</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. I was afraid.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Afreed o' what&mdash;hurtin' yourself?</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. No, afraid of the consequences.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Whad d'ye mean?</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. Do you believe in another life after this one?</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. I kan't say ez I ever give it much thought.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. Well, don't&mdash;because if you do you'll never kill another Crosby
... not even a revenue officer.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. 'Tain't that bad, is it?</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. Worse. Twenty times I've had a revolver to my head&mdash;crazy to
die&mdash;and then as my finger pressed the trigger I'd get a terrible
dread&mdash;a dread that I was plunging into worse terrors than this world
ever knew. If killing were the end it would be easy, but what if it's
only the beginning of something worse?</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Well, you gotta take some chances.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. I'll not take that one. You know, Mr. Luke, life was given to
us by some one who probably never intended that we should take it, and
that some one has something ready for people who destroy his property.
That's what frightens me.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. You do too much worryin' to be a regular suicide.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. Yes, I do. That's why I changed my plan.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. What plan?</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. My plan for dying.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Oh, then you didn't give up the idea?<a name="page_249" id="page_249"></a></p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. No, indeed&mdash;I'm still determined to die, but I'm going to make
some one else responsible.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Oh&mdash;so you hain't willing to pay fer yer own funeral music?</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. No, sir. I'll furnish the passenger, but some one else must buy
the ticket. You see, when I finally decided I'd be killed, I immediately
exposed myself to every danger I knew.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. How?</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. In a thousand ways.... [<i>Pause.</i>] Did you ever see an
automobile?</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. No.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. They go faster than steam engines, and they don't <i>stay</i> on
tracks. Did you ever hear of Fifth Avenue, New York?</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. No.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. Fifth Avenue is jammed with automobiles, eight deep all day
long. People being killed every day. I crossed Fifth Avenue a thousand
times a day, every day for weeks, never once trying to get out of the
way, and always praying I'd be hit.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. And couldn't yu git hit?</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. [<i>In disgust.</i>] No. Automobiles only hit people who try to get
out of the way. [<i>Pause.</i>] When that failed, I frequented the lowest
dives on the Bowery, flashing a roll of money and wearing diamonds,
hoping they'd kill me for them. They stole the money and diamonds, but
never touched me.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Couldn't you pick a fight?</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. I'm coming to that. You know up North they believe that a man
can be killed in the South for calling another man a liar.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. That's right.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. It is, is it? Well, I've called men liars from Washington to
Atlanta, and I'm here to tell you about it.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. They must a took pity on ye.<a name="page_250" id="page_250"></a></p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. Do you know Two Gun Jake that keeps the dive down in Henderson?</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. I should think I do.... Jake's killed enough of 'em.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. He's a bad man, ain't he?</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. He's no trifler.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. I wound up in Jake's place two nights ago, pretending to be
drunk. Jake was cursing niggers.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. He's allus doin' that.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. So I elbowed my way up to the bar and announced that I was an
expert in the discovery of nigger blood ... could tell a nigger who was
63-64ths white.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Ye kin?</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. No, I can't, but I made them believe it. I then offered to look
them over and tell them if they had any nigger blood in them. A few of
them sneaked away, but the rest stood for it. I passed them all until I
got to Two Gun Jake. I examined his eyeballs, looked at his
finger-nails, and said, "You're a nigger."</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. An' what did Jake do?</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. He turned pale, took me into the back room. He said: "Honest to
God, mister, can ye see nigger blood in me?" I said: "Yes." "There's no
mistake about it?" "Not a bit," I answered. "Good God," he said, "I
always suspected it." Then he pulled out his gun&mdash;</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Eh ... eh?</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. And shot <i>himself</i>.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Jake shot hisself!... Is he dead?</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. I don't know&mdash;I was too disgusted to wait. I wandered around
until I thought of you moonshiners ... scrambled around in the mountains
until I found your still. I <i>sat</i> on it and waited until you boys showed
up, and here I am, and you're going to kill me.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. [<i>Pause.</i>] Ah, so ye want us to do yer killin' fer ye, do ye?<a name="page_251" id="page_251"></a></p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. You're my last hope. If I fail this time I may as well give it
up.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. [<i>Takes out revolver, turns sidewise and secretly removes
cartridges from chamber. Rises.</i>] What wuz that noise?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Lays revolver on table and steps outside of door.</i> <span class="smcap">Revenue</span> <i>looks

that-a-way. Didn't you see it?</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. Yes.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Well, why didn't ye grab it?</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. What for?</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. To git the drop on me.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. Can't you understand what I've been telling you, mister? I
don't <i>want</i> the drop on you.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Well, doggone if I don't believe yer tellin' me the truth. Thought
I'd just see what ye'd do. Ye see, I emptied it first.</p>

<p class="r">[<i>Opens up gun.</i></p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. That wasn't necessary.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Well, I reckon ye better git along out o' here, mister.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. You don't mean you're weakening?</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. I ain't got no call to do your killin' fer you. If ye hain't sport
enough to do it yerself, I reckon ye kin go on sufferin'.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. But I told you why I don't want to do it. One murder more or
less means nothing to you. You don't care anything about the hereafter.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Mebbe I don't, but there ain't no use my takin' any more chances
than I have to. And what's more, mister, from what you been tellin' me I
reckon there's a charm on you, and I ain't goin' to take no chances
goin' agin charms.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. So <i>you're</i> going to go back on me?</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Yes, siree.<a name="page_252" id="page_252"></a></p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. Well, maybe some of the other boys will be willing. I'll wait
till they come.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. The other boys ain't goin' to see you. You're a leavin' this yer
place right now&mdash;now! It won't do no good. You may as well go peaceable;
ye ain't got no right to expect us to bear yer burdens.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. Damn it all! I've spoiled it again.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. I reckon you better make up yer mind to go on livin'.</p>

<p>R<small>EVENUE</small>. That looks like the only way out.</p>

<p>L<small>UKE</small>. Come on, I'll let you ride my horse to town. It's the only one we
got, so yu can leave it at Two Gun Jake's, and one o' the boys'll go git
it, or I reckon I'll go over myself and see if Jake made a job of it.</p>

<p>Paul Hervieu, one of the foremost of contemporary French dramatists, was
born in 1857 at Neuilly, near Paris. Although he prepared for the bar,
having passed the examination at twenty, and practised his profession
for a few years, he soon set to writing short stories and novels which
appeared in the early eighties. <i>The Nippers</i>, in 1890, established his
reputation as a dramatist. The remainder of his life was given to
writing for the stage. In 1900 he was elected to the French Academy. He
died October 15, 1915.</p>

<p>In addition to <i>The Nippers</i>, Hervieu's best-known long plays are <i>The
Passing of the Torch</i>, <i>The Labyrinth</i>, and <i>Know Thyself</i>.</p>

<p><i>Modesty</i> is his well-known one-act play. In subtlety of technic and in
delicacy of touch it is one of the finest examples of French one-act
plays. Its humor and light, graceful satire are noteworthy.<a name="page_258" id="page_258"></a></p>

good friends! And now you're going to be angry.</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. Why?</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. Because I'm not going to give you the sort of answer you'd
like.</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. You don't&mdash;you don't think I'd make a good husband?</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. Frankly, no.</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. I don't please you?</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. As a cousin you are charming; as a husband you would be quite
impossible.</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. What have you against me?</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. Nothing that you're to blame for. It is merely the fault of
my character; <i>that</i> forces me to refuse you.<a name="page_260" id="page_260"></a></p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. But I can't see why you&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. [<i>With an air of great importance.</i>] A great change is taking
place in the hearts of us women. We have resolved henceforward not to be
treated as dolls, but as creatures of reason. As for me, I am most
unfortunate, for nobody ever did anything but flatter me. I have always
been too self-satisfied, too&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. You have always been the most charming of women, the most&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. Stop! It's exactly that sort of exaggeration that's begun to
make me so unsure of myself. I want you to understand once for all,
Jacques, I have a conscience, and, furthermore, it is beginning to
develop. I have taken some important resolutions.</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. What <i>do</i> you mean?</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. I have resolved to better myself, to raise my moral and
intellectual standards, and to do that I must be guided, criticised&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. But you already possess every imaginable quality! You are
charitable, cultured, refined&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. [<i>Annoyed.</i>] Please!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Turns away and sits on settee.</i> <span class="smcap">Jacques</span> <i>addresses her from
behind chair</i>.</p></div>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. You are discreet, witty&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. The same old compliments! Everybody tells me that. I want to
be preached to, contradicted, scolded&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. You could never stand <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. Yes, I could. I should be happy to profit by the criticism.
It would inspire me.</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. I'd like to see the man who has the audacity to criticise you
to your face&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. That is enough! I trust you are aware that you are not the
person fit to exercise this influence over me?</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. How could I? Everything about you pleases me. It can never be
otherwise.<a name="page_261" id="page_261"></a></p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. How interesting! That's the very reason I rejected your
proposal. I sha'n't marry until I am certain that I shall not be
continually pestered with compliments and flattery and submission. The
man who marries me shall make it his business to remind me of my
shortcomings, to correct all my mistakes. He must give me the assurance
that I am continually bettering myself.</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. And this&mdash;husband&mdash;have you found him already?</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. What&mdash;? Oh, who knows?</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. Perhaps it's&mdash;Albert?</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. Perhaps it is&mdash;what of it?</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. Really!</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. You want me to speak frankly?</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. Of course.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. Then&mdash;you wouldn't be annoyed if I said something nice about
Albert?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Jacques</span> <i>brings down</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>chair which is by desk, facing</i>
<span class="smcap">Henriette</span>.</p></div>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. Why, he's your friend!</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. Oh! So you, too, have a good opinion of him?</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. Certainly.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. Well, what would you say of him?</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. [<i>Trying to be fair.</i>] I'd trust him with money&mdash;I've never
heard he was a thief.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. But in other ways?</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. [<i>Still conscientious.</i>] I believe him to be
somewhat&mdash;somewhat&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. Wilful? Headstrong?</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. Um&mdash;uncultured, let us say.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. As you like&mdash;but for my part, I find that that air of his
inspires absolute confidence. He knows how to be severe at times&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. You're mistaken about that; that's only simple brute force. Go
to the Zoo: the ostrich, the boa constrictor, the rhinoceros, all
produce the same effect on you as your Albert&mdash;&mdash;<a name="page_262" id="page_262"></a></p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. My Albert? My Albert? Oh, I don't appropriate him so quickly
as all that. His qualifications as censor are not yet entirely
demonstrated.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Jacques</span> <i>rises and approaches</i> <span class="smcap">Henriette</span>, <i>who maintains an air of

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. For heaven's sake, Henriette, stop this nonsense!</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. What nonsense?</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. Tell me you are only playing with me. That you only wanted to
put my love to the test! To make me jealous! To torture me! You have
succeeded. Stop it, for heaven's sake&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. My dear friend, I'm very sorry for you. I wish I could help
you, but I cannot. I have given you a perfect description of the husband
I want, and I am heart-broken that you bear so remote a resemblance to
him.</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. Only promise you will think over your decision.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. It is better to stop right now.</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. Don't send me away like this. Don't&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. I might give you false hopes. I have only to tell you that I
shall never consent to be the wife of a man who cannot be the severest
of censors.</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. [<i>Kneeling.</i>] I beg you!</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. No, no, no, Jacques! Spare me that. [<i>A telephone rings in
the next room.</i>] There's the 'phone&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. Don't go!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Henriette</span> <i>rises hastily and goes to door</i>. <span class="smcap">Jacques</span> <i>tries for a

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. I must go. Go away, I tell you. I'll be furious if I find you
here when I come back.</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. Henriette!</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. [<i>Coming down</i> L. <i>to table</i>.] Not now! Please, Jacques.
[<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. I can't leave it that way. I am the husband who<a name="page_263" id="page_263"></a> will make her
happy. But how? That is the question. [<i>Pause.</i>] Ah, Albert!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Albert</span>. <i>He shakes hands with</i> <span class="smcap">Jacques</span>.</p></div>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. How are you, rival?</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. [<i>Gravely.</i>] My friend, we are no longer rivals.</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. How's that?</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. I have just had a talk with Henriette; she refuses to marry
either one of us.</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. Did she mention me?</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. Casually.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Both sit down</i>, <span class="smcap">Albert</span> <i>on sofa</i>, <span class="smcap">Jacques</span> <i>on chair near it</i>.</p></div>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. What did she say?</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. Oh, I wouldn't repeat it; it wouldn't be friendly.</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. I <i>must</i> know.</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. Very well, then&mdash;she said that you had not succeeded&mdash;nor had
I&mdash;to find the way to her heart. Between you and me, we've got a
high-minded woman to deal with, a philosopher who detests flattery. It
seems you have been in the habit of paying her compliments&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. I never pay compliments.</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. Whatever you did, she didn't like it. Moreover&mdash;since you want
the whole truth&mdash;you seem to her a bit&mdash;ridiculous.</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. Pardon?</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. The very word: ridiculous. She wants a husband who will act as
a sort of conscience pilot. Evidently, you haven't appealed to her in
that capacity.</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. Sometimes I used to be rather sharp with her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. You did it too daintily, perhaps; you lacked severity. I'll
wager you smiled, instead of scowled&mdash;that would have been fatal!</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. I don't understand.</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. Henriette is a singular woman; to get her, you<a name="page_264" id="page_264"></a> have to tell
her that you don't like her&mdash;her pride demands it. Tell her all her bad
qualities, straight from the shoulder.</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. [<i>Feeling himself equal to the task.</i>] Don't worry about that!
[<i>Rises and walks about.</i>] I know women love to be told things straight
out.</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. I'm not the man for that; nor are you, I suppose?</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. No? Jacques, I'm awfully obliged to you; you've done me a good
turn&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>, Don't mention it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. You want to do me one more favor?</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. [<i>Devotedly.</i>] Anything you like!</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. Promise me you'll never let Henrietta know that you told me
this?</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. I promise; but why?</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. You know she has to understand that my behavior toward her is in
character. Natural, you see.</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. Oh, you're going at it strenuously.</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. I am.</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. Your decision honors you.</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. Let's not have Henriette find us together. Would you mind
disappearing?</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. With pleasure. I'll look in later and get the news.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Jacques</span> <i>rises</i>.</p></div>

How are you? [<i>Pause.</i>] Have you seen Jacques?</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. [<i>With a determined air.</i>] No, Henriette. Thank God!</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. Why?</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. Because it pains me to see men in your presence whom you care
nothing for.<a name="page_265" id="page_265"></a></p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. [<i>Delighted.</i>] You don't like that?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Sitting down on sofa.</i></p></div>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. No, I don't. And I'd like to tell you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. About my relations with Jacques?</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. Oh, he's not the only one.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. Heaps of others, I suppose?</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. [<i>Sits on chair near sofa.</i>] You suppose correctly; heaps.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. Really?</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. You are a coquette.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. You think so?</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. I am positive.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. I suppose I displease you in other ways, too?</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. In a great many other ways.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. [<i>Really delighted.</i>] How confidently you say that!</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. So much the worse if you don't like it!</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. Quite the contrary, my dear Albert; you can't imagine how you
please me when you talk like that. It's perfectly adorable.</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. It makes very little difference to me whether I please you or
not. I speak according to my temperament. Perhaps it is a bit
authoritative, but I can't help <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. You are superb.</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. Oh, no. I'm just myself.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. Oh, if you were only the&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. I haven't the slightest idea what you were about to say, but
I'll guarantee that there's not a more inflexible temper than mine in
Paris.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. I can easily believe it. [<i>Pause.</i>] Now tell me in what way
you think I'm coquettish.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Sitting on edge of sofa in an interested attitude.</i> <span class="smcap">Albert</span> <i>takes
out cigarette, lights and smokes it</i>.</p></div>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. That's easy; for instance, when you go to the theatre, to a
reception, to the races. As soon as you arrive the men flock about in
dozens; those who don't know you come to be introduced. You're the
talking-stock of society. Now I should be greatly obliged if you would
tell me to what you attribute this notoriety?</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. [<i>Modestly.</i>] Well, I should attribute it to the fact that I
am&mdash;agreeable, and pleasant&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. There are many women no less so.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. [<i>Summoning up all her modesty to reply.</i>] You force me to
recognize the fact&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. And I know many women fully as pleasant as you who don't flaunt
their favors in the face of everybody; <i>they</i> preserve some semblance of
dignity, a certain air of aloof distinction that it would do you no harm
to acquire.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. [<i>With a gratitude that is conscious of its bounds.</i>] Thanks,
thanks so much. [<i>Drawing back to a corner of the sofa.</i>] I am deeply
obliged to you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. Not at all.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. In the future I shall try to behave more decorously.</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. Another thing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. [<i>The first signs of impatience begin to appear.</i>] What?
Another thing to criticise?</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. A thousand! [<i>Settling himself comfortably.</i></p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. Well, hurry up.</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. You must rid yourself of your excessive and ridiculous
school-girl sentimentality.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. I wonder just on what you base your statement. Would you
oblige me so far as to explain that?</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. With pleasure. I remember one day in the country you were in
tears because a <i>poor</i> little mouse had fallen into the claws of a
<i>wretched</i> cat; two minutes later you were sobbing because the <i>poor</i>
cat choked in swallowing the <i>wretched</i> little mouse.<a name="page_267" id="page_267"></a></p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. That was only my kindness to dumb animals. Is it wrong to be
kind to dumb animals?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She is about to rise when</i> <span class="smcap">Albert</span> <i>stops her with a gesture</i>.</p></div>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. That would be of no consequence, if it weren't that you were of
so contradictory a nature that you engage in the emptiest, most
frivolous conversations, the most&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. [<i>Slightly disdainful.</i>] Ah, you are going too far! You make
me doubt your power of analysis. I am interested only in noble and high
things&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. And yet as soon as the conversation takes a serious turn, it's
appalling to see you; you yawn and look bored to extinction.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. There you are right&mdash;partly.</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. You see!</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. [<i>Sharp and even antagonistic.</i>] Yes, I have that unfortunate
gift of understanding things before people have finished explaining
them. While the others are waiting for the explanation, I can't wait,
and I fly on miles ahead&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. Hm&mdash;that sounds probable; I sha'n't say anything more about that
just now. But while I'm on the subject, I have more than once noticed
that you are guilty of the worst vice woman ever possessed&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. And what, if you please?</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. Vanity.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. I vain? Oh, you're going too far!</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. [<i>Unruffled.</i>] Not a word! Every time I tell you a fault, you
twist it round to your own advantage. Whereas you are really worse&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. [<i>Rising and gathering her skirts about her with virtuous
indignation.</i>] You are rude! I suppose you would find fault with me if I
considered myself more polite than the person whom I have the honor to
address?</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. I hope you don't intend that remark as personal.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. I certainly do.<a name="page_268" id="page_268"></a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She crosses to the other side of the stage and sits down.</i> <span class="smcap">Albert</span>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. Henriette! No! [<i>Laughing.</i>] I see your trick.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. What do you mean?</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. You can't deceive me by pretending to be angry. You wanted to
see whether I could withstand your temper. Let us now proceed to the

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. And then you'll begin again to-morrow!</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. Yes.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. And do you think for one minute that I'll listen to you while
you insult me to my face? <i>You</i> are the vain one, to think you can come
to that! <i>You</i> are the frivolous one, <i>you</i> are the&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. [<i>Slightly perturbed.</i>] Be careful what you say!</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. I'll take care of that. Let me tell you that you are a
detestable cynic. You are disgustingly personal; always dwelling on
details, on the least&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. Which is as much as calling me a fool?</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. Just about. You would be if you didn't read your morning
paper regularly; so regularly that I know in advance exactly what you
are going to say to me during the day.</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. Why not call me a parrot?</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. That would flatter you, for you don't speak as well as a
parrot; a parrot's memory never gets clouded, a parrot has at least the
common politeness to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. [<i>Between his teeth.</i>] I won't stand for this. I wonder how you
could have endured me so long if you thought me such a fool.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. I believed you harmless.</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. Are you aware that you have wounded me cruelly?<a name="page_269" id="page_269"></a></p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. <i>You</i> have wounded <i>me</i>. Thank heaven, though, we had this
discussion! Now I'll know how to conduct myself toward you in the
future.</p>

<p>A<small>LBERT</small>. Thank heaven for the same thing! It was high time! I grieve to
think that only last night I had fully made up my mind to ask you to be
my wife!</p>

immediately.</p>

things about me; criticised me to my face!</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. He did!</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. It was so ridiculous&mdash;makes me sick to think about it.</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. My dear Henriette, don't think about it. Albert must have
behaved like a brute to make you so angry.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. Yes, don't you think so? <i>You</i> think I'm right?</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. [<i>Loyally.</i>] Of course I do.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. [<i>At her ease once more.</i>] You encourage me, Jacques.</p>

is right."</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. Really?</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. I said it because I knew you were by nature peace-loving and

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. [<i>With profound conviction.</i>] Well, I think that's the least
that could be said of me.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. <i>You</i> know me, Jacques!</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. I flatter myself. I felt instinctively you couldn't be wrong.
You have always been so admirably poised, so unfailingly considerate.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. [<i>With perfect simplicity.</i>] Frankly now, do I ever lose my
temper with you?</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. Yes, I was unhappy. But "if after every storm comes such a
calm"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. It was all my fault. You understand me; you are truly a
friend.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. [<i>With downcast eyes.</i>] I was just thinking about it. [<i>Same

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. Jacques, do you remember what I told you not long ago?</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. In spite of that, are you quite sure that I am not vain or
coquettish?</p>

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. I am certain.</p>

<p>H<small>ENRIETTE</small>. You are also firmly resolved to be my moral guide, critic,

<p>J<small>ACQUES</small>. [<i>Stolid as ever.</i>] I am.</p>

<p>Jeannette Marks, well-known essayist, poet, and playwright, was born in
1875 at Chattanooga, Tennessee, but spent her early life in
Philadelphia, where her father, the late William Dennis Marks, was
professor of dynamics in the University of Pennsylvania and president of
the Edison Electric Light Company. She attended school in Dresden, and
in 1900 was graduated from Wellesley College. She obtained her master's
degree from Wellesley in 1903. Her graduate studies were continued at
the Bodleian Library and at the British Museum. Since 1901 she has been
on the staff of the English Department at Mount Holyoke College, South
Hadley, Massachusetts. Her chief courses are Nineteenth Century Poetry
and Play-writing.</p>

<p>Miss Marks's interest in Welsh life is the result of her hiking several
summers among the Welsh hills and valleys. She became intimately
acquainted with Welsh peasant life. It is said that Edward Knobloch,
well-known dramatist, on one of her homeward voyages from one of her
summer outings in Wales, pointed out to Miss Marks the dramatic
possibilities of the material she had thus acquired. <i>Three Welsh Plays</i>
was the result. Two of these plays, without the author's knowledge, were
entered in 1911 for the Welsh National Theatre prize contest. To her
credit, the plays won the prize. The complete volume appeared in 1917.</p>

<p><i>The Deacon's Hat</i> is a fine study of the life of the common folk of
Wales.<a name="page_276" id="page_276"></a></p>

<p class="hang">SCENE: <i>A little shop called Y Gegin (The Kitchen), in Bala, North
Wales.</i></p>

<p class="hang">TIME: <i>Monday morning at half-past eleven.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>To the right is the counter of Y Gegin, set out with a bountiful
supply of groceries; behind the counter are grocery-stocked
shelves. Upon the counter is a good-sized enamel-ware bowl filled
with herring pickled in brine and leek, also a basket of fresh
eggs, a jar of pickles, some packages of codfish, a half dozen
loaves of bread, a big round cheese, several pounds of butter
wrapped in print paper, etc., etc.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>To the left are a cheerful glowing fire and ingle.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>At the back center is a door; between the door and the fire stands
a grandfather's clock with a shining brass face. Between the clock
and the door, back centre, is a small tridarn [Welsh dresser] and a
chair. From the rafters hang flitches of bacon, hams, bunches of
onions, herbs, etc. On either side of the fireplace are latticed
windows, showing a glimpse of the street. Before the fire is a
small, round, three-legged table; beside it a tall, straight-backed
chair.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Between the table and left is a door which is the entrance to Y
Gegin and from which, on a metal elbow, dangles a large bell.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>At rise of curtain Hugh Williams enters at back centre, absorbed
in reading a volume of Welsh theological essays. He is dressed in a
brightly striped vest, a short, heavy cloth coat, cut away in front
and with lapels trimmed with brass buttons, swallowtails<a name="page_278" id="page_278"></a> behind,
also trimmed with brass buttons, stock wound around his neck, and
tight trousers down to his boot-tops.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Neli Williams, his wife, a comely, capable young woman, busy with
her knitting every instant she talks, is clad in her market
costume, a scarlet cloak, and a tall black Welsh beaver. Over her
arm is an immense basket.</i></p>

</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. [<i>Commandingly.</i>] Hughie, put down that book!</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. [<i>Still going on reading.</i>] Haven't I just said a man is his own
master, whatever!</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. Hughie, ye're to mind the shop while I'm gone!</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. [<i>Patiently.</i>] Yiss, yiss.</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. I don't think ye hear a word I am sayin' whatever.</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. Yiss, I hear every word ye're sayin'.</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. What is it, then?</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. [<i>Weakly.</i>] 'Tis all about&mdash;about&mdash;the&mdash;the weather whatever!</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. Ye've not heard a word, an' ye're plannin' to read that book from
cover to cover, I can see.</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. [<i>A little too quickly.</i>] Nay, I have no plans....</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He tucks book away in back coat pocket over-hastily.</i></p></div>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. Hugh!</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. [<i>Weakly.</i>] Nay, I <i>have</i> no plans whatever!</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. [<i>Reproachfully.</i>] Hugh&mdash;<i>ie</i>! 'Twould be the end of sellin'
anythin' to anybody if I leave ye with a book whatever! Give me that
book!</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. [<i>Obstinately.</i>] Nay, I'll no read the book.</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. Give me that book!</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. [<i>Rising a little.</i>] Nay. I say a man is his own master whatever!</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. [<i>Finding the book hidden in his coat-tail pocket.</i>] Is he? Well,
I'll no leave ye with any masterful temptations to be readin'.</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. Ye've no cause to take this book away from me.<a name="page_279" id="page_279"></a></p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. [<i>Opens book and starts with delight.</i>] 'Tis Deacon Roberts's new
book on "The Flamin' Wickedness of Babylon." Where did ye get it?</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. [<i>Reassured by her interest.</i>] He lent it to me this morning.</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. [<i>Resolutely.</i>] Well, I will take it away from ye this noon till I
am home again whatever!</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. [<i>Sulkily.</i>] Sellin' groceries is not salvation. They sold
groceries in Babylon; Deacon Roberts says so.</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. [<i>Looking at book with ill-disguised eagerness.</i>] I dunno as
anybody ever found salvation by givin' away all he had for nothin'! 'Tis
certain Deacon Roberts has not followed that way.</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. [<i>Still sulkily.</i>] A man is his own master, I say.</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. [<i>Absent-mindedly, her nose in the book.</i>] Is he? Well, indeed!</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. [<i>Crossly.</i>] Aye, he is. [<i>Pointedly.</i>] An' I was not plannin' to
give away the book whatever.</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. [<i>Closing volume with a little sigh, as for stolen delights, and
speaking hastily.</i>] An' I am not talkin' about acceptin' books, but
about butter an' eggs an' cheese an' all the other groceries!</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. Aye, ye'll get no blessin' from such worldliness.</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. [<i>Absent-mindedly.</i>] Maybe not, but ye will get a dinner from that
unblessed worldliness an' find no fault, I'm thinkin'. [<i>Her hand
lingering on the book, which she opens.</i>] But such wonderful theology!
An' such eloquence! Such an understandin' of sin! Such glowin' pictures
of Babylon!</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. Aye, hot! I tell ye, Neli, there's no man in the parish has such a
gift of eloquence as Deacon Roberts or such theology. In all Wales ye'll
not find stronger theology than his.</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. Ye have no need to tell me that! [<i>Looking for a place in which to
hide the book until she returns.</i>] Have I not a deep an' proper
admiration for theology? Have I not had one minister<a name="page_280" id="page_280"></a> an' five deacons
an' a revivalist in my family, to say nothin' at all of one composer of
hymns?</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. Yiss, yiss. Aye, 'tis a celebrated family. I am no sayin' anythin'
against your family.</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. Then what?</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. [<i>Pleadingly.</i>] Deacon Roberts has great fire with which to save
souls. We're needin' that book on Babylon's wickedness. Give it back to
me, Neli!</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. Oh, aye! [<i>Looks at husband.</i>] I'm not sayin' but that ye are
wicked, Hugh, an' needin' these essays, for ye have no ministers and
deacons and hymn composers among your kin.</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. [<i>Triumphantly.</i>] Aye, aye, that's it! That's it! An' the more
need have I to read till my nostrils are full of the smoke of&mdash;of
Babylon.</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. [<i>Absent-mindedly tucking book away on shelf as she talks.</i>] Aye,
but there has been some smoke about Deacon Roberts's reputation which
has come from some fire less far away than Babylon.</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. What smoke?</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. [<i>Evasively.</i>] Well, I am thinkin' about my eggs which vanished
one week ago to-day. There was no one in that mornin' but Deacon
Roberts. Mrs. Jones the Wash had come for her soap an' gone before I
filled that basket with eggs.</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. [<i>Watching her covertly, standing on tiptoe and craning his neck
as she stows away book.</i>] Yiss, yiss!</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. [<i>Slyly.</i>] Ask Deacon Roberts if cats steal eggs whatever?</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. [<i>Repeating.</i>] If cats steal eggs, if cats steal eggs.</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. Aye, not if eggs steal cats.</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. [<i>Craning neck.</i>] Yiss, yiss, if eggs steal cats!</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. Hugh&mdash;<i>ie</i>! Now ye'll never get it correct again! 'Tis if cats
steal eggs.</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. [<i>Sulkily.</i>] Well, I'm no carin' about cats with heaven starin' me
in the face.<a name="page_281" id="page_281"></a></p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. Hughie, lad, ye're not to touch the book while I am gone to
market.</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. Nay, nay, certainly not!</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. And ye're to be on the lookout for Mrs. Jones the Wash, for Mrs.
Jenkins the Midwife&mdash;Jane Elin has a new baby, an' it'll be needin'
somethin'. [<i>Pointing to counter.</i>] Here is everythin' plainly marked.
Ye're no to undersell or give away anythin.' D'ye hear?</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. Aye, I hear!</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. An' remember where the tobacco is, for this is the day Tom Morris
the Sheep comes in.</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. Aye, in the glass jar.</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. Good-by. I will return soon.</p>

even any theology!</p>

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. [<i>Stepping quickly away from shelves and repeating parrotlike.</i>]
Nay, nay, no readin', no sermons, not even any theology!</p>

<p>N<small>ELI</small>. An' no salvation till I come back!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She smiles, withdraws head, and is gone.</i> <span class="smcap">Hugh</span> <i>starts forward,

<p>H<small>UGH</small>. [<i>Mournfully.</i>] Look at this! What did I say but that there was no
salvation sellin' groceries! If Neli could but see those eggs! [<i>He goes
behind counter and gets out a box of<a name="page_282" id="page_282"></a> eggs, from which he refills the
basket. The broken eggs he leaves untouched upon the floor. He opens his
volume of sermons and seats himself by a little three-legged table near
the fire. He sighs in happy anticipation. Hearing a slight noise, he
looks suspiciously at door, gets up, tiptoes across floor to street
door, and locks it quietly. An expression of triumph overspreads his
face.</i>] Da, if customers come, they will think no one is at home
whatever, an' I can read on! [<i>He seats himself at little three-legged
table, opens volume, smooths over its pages lovingly, and begins to read

<p>B<small>OB</small>. Yes; Ed Russell rented a house that had just been built.</p>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. A perfectly darling little house! And Fanny Russell once told me
that the man who built it will put up a house for any one who will take
a five-year lease. And she says that<a name="page_306" id="page_306"></a> the man is very competent and they
are simply delighted with their place.</p>

<p>B<small>OB</small>. Why don't we get in touch with the man?</p>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. Wasn't it stupid of me not to think about it? It just flashed
into my mind this morning, and I sat down at once and sent a
special-delivery letter to Fanny Russell. I asked her to tell me his
name at once, and where we can find him.</p>

<p>B<small>OB</small>. Good! You ought to have an answer by to-morrow or Thursday and
we'll go up north and have a talk with him on Saturday.</p>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. [<i>With enthusiasm.</i>] Wouldn't it be wonderful if he'd build just
what we want! Fanny Russell says every detail of their house is perfect.
Even the garage; they use it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>B<small>OB</small>. [<i>Interrupting.</i>] Mollie, that's the one thing I'm afraid of about
the North Shore plan. I've said repeatedly that I don't want to buy a
car for another year or two. But here you are, talking about a garage
already.</p>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. But you didn't let me finish what I was saying. The Russells
have fitted up their garage as a playroom for the children. If we had a
garage we could do the same thing.</p>

<p>B<small>OB</small>. Well, let's keep temptation behind us and not even talk to the man
about a garage. If we move up north it must be on an economy basis for a
few years; just a half-way step between the apartment and the house we
used to plan. You mustn't get your heart set on a car.</p>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. I haven't even thought of one, dear. [<span class="smcap">Bob</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mollie</span> <i>have now
both finished the bouillon course and lay down their spoons. Reaching
out her hand to touch the table button, and at the same time leaning
across the table and speaking very impressively.</i>] Bob, I'm about to
ring for Hilda!</p>

<p>B<small>OB</small>. What of it?</p>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. [<i>Decidedly and with a touch of impatience.</i>] You know very
well, what of it. I don't want Hilda to hear us say one word about
moving away from the South Side!<a name="page_307" id="page_307"></a></p>

<p>B<small>OB</small>. [<i>Protesting.</i>] But Mollie&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. [<i>Interrupting hurriedly and holding her finger to her lips in
warning.</i>] Psst!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The next instant</i> <span class="smcap">Hilda</span> <i>enters, left. She is a tall, blonde
Swedish girl, about twenty-five years old. She is very pretty and
carries herself well and looks particularly charming in a maid's
dress, with white collars and cuffs and a dainty waitress's apron.
Every detail of her dress is immaculate.</i></p></div>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. [<i>Speaking the instant that</i> <span class="smcap">Hilda</span> <i>appears and talking very
rapidly all the time that</i> <span class="smcap">Hilda</span> <i>remains in the room. While she speaks</i>
<span class="smcap">Mollie</span> <i>watches</i> <span class="smcap">Hilda</span> <i>rather than</i> <span class="smcap">Robert</span>, <i>whom she pretends to be
addressing</i>.] In the last game Gert Jones was my partner. It was frame
apiece and I dealt and I bid one no trump. I had a very weak no trump.
I'll admit that, but I didn't want them to win the rubber. Mrs. Stone
bid two spades and Gert Jones doubled her. Mrs. Green passed and I
simply couldn't go to three of anything. Mrs. Stone played two spades,
doubled, and she made them. Of course, that put them out and gave them
the rubber. I think that was a very foolish double of Gert Jones, and
then she said it was my fault, because I bid one no trump.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>As</i> <span class="smcap">Mollie</span> <i>begins her flow of words</i> <span class="smcap">Bob</span> <i>first looks at her in
open-mouthed astonishment. Then as he gradually comprehends that</i>
<span class="smcap">Mollie</span> <i>is merely talking against time he too turns his eyes to</i>
<span class="smcap">Hilda</span> <i>and watches her closely in her movements around the table.
Meanwhile</i> <span class="smcap">Hilda</span> <i>moves quietly and quickly and pays no attention
to anything except the work she has in hand. She carries a small
serving-tray, and, as</i> <span class="smcap">Mollie</span> <i>speaks</i>, <span class="smcap">Hilda</span> <i>first takes the
bouillon cups from the table, then brings the carving-knife and
fork from the sideboard and places them before</i> <span class="smcap">Robert</span>, <i>and then,
with the empty bouillon cups, exits left</i>. <span class="smcap">Bob</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mollie</span> <i>are
both watching</i> <span class="smcap">Hilda</span> <i>as<a name="page_308" id="page_308"></a> she goes out. The instant the door swings
shut behind her</i>, <span class="smcap">Mollie</span> <i>relaxes with a sigh, and</i> <span class="smcap">Robert</span> <i>leans
across the table to speak</i>.</p></div>

<p>B<small>OB</small>. Mollie, why not be sensible about this thing! Have a talk with
Hilda and find out if she will move north with us.</p>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. That's just like a man! Then we might not find a house to please
us and Hilda would be dissatisfied and suspicious. She might even leave.
[<i>Thoughtfully.</i>] Of course, I must speak to her before we sign a lease,
because I really don't know what I'd do if Hilda refused to leave the
South side. [<i>More cheerfully.</i>] But there, we won't think about the
disagreeable things until everything is settled.</p>

<p>B<small>OB</small>. That's good American doctrine.</p>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. [<i>Warningly and again touching her finger to her lips.</i>] Psst!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Hilda</span> <i>enters, left, carrying the meat plates, with a heavy napkin
under them</i>.</p></div>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. [<i>Immediately resuming her monologue.</i>] I think my last year's
hat will do very nicely. You know it rained all last summer and I really
only wore the hat a half a dozen times. Perhaps not that often. I can
make a few changes on it; put on some new ribbons, you know, and it will
do very nicely for another year. You remember that hat, don't you dear?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Bob</span> <i>starts to answer, but</i> <span class="smcap">Mollie</span> <i>rushes right on</i>.</p></div>

<p>Of course you do, you remember you said it was so becoming. That's
another reason why I want to wear it this summer.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Hilda</span>, <i>meanwhile, puts the plates on the table in front of</i> <span class="smcap">Bob</span>,

<p>B<small>OB</small>. [<i>Holding his hands over the plates as over a fire and rubbing them
together in genial warmth.</i>] Ah, the good hot plates! She never forgets
them. She <i>is</i> a gem, Mollie.</p>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. [<i>In great self-satisfaction.</i>] If you are finally convinced of
that, after three years, I wish you would be a little bit<a name="page_309" id="page_309"></a> more careful
what you say the next time Hilda comes in the room.</p>

<p>B<small>OB</small>. [<i>In open-mouthed astonishment.</i>] What!</p>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. Well, I don't want Hilda to think we are making plans behind her
back.</p>

<p>B<small>OB</small>. [<i>Reflectively.</i>] "A man's home is his castle." [<i>Pauses.</i>] It's
very evident that the Englishman who first said that didn't keep any
servants.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Telephone bell rings off stage.</i></p></div>

<p>B<small>OB</small>. Won't Hilda answer it?</p>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. [<i>Standing up quickly and speaking impatiently.</i>] Very well, I
shall answer it myself. I can't ask Hilda to run to the telephone while
she is serving the meal.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Hilda</span> <i>speaks excellent English, but with some Swedish accent. The

<p>B<small>OB</small>. [<i>Standing at his chair.</i>] But I thought Hilda couldn't be running
to the telephone while she serves the dinner?</p>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. But this call is for Hilda, herself. That's quite different, you
see.</p>

<p>B<small>OB</small>. [<i>Slowly and thoughtfully.</i>] Oh, yes! Of course; I see! [<i>Sits down
in his chair.</i>] That is&mdash;I don't quite see!</p>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. [<i>Immediately leaning across the table and speaking in a
cautious whisper.</i>] Do you know who it is?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Bob</span> <i>closes his lips very tightly and nods yes in a very important
manner</i>.</p></div>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. [<i>In the same whisper and very impatiently.</i>] Who?</p>

<p>B<small>OB</small>. [<i>Looking around the room as if to see if any one is in hiding, and
then putting his hand to his mouth and exaggerating the whisper.</i>] The
Terrible Swede.</p>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. [<i>In her ordinary tone and very much exasperated.</i>] Robert, I've
told you a hundred times that you shouldn't refer to&mdash;to&mdash;the man in
that way.</p>

<p>B<small>OB</small>. And I've told you a hundred times to ask Hilda his name. If I knew
his name I'd announce him with as much ceremony as if he were the
Swedish Ambassador.</p>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. [<i>Disgusted.</i>] Oh, don't try to be funny! Suppose some day Hilda
hears you speak of him in that manner?</p>

<p>B<small>OB</small>. You know that's mild compared to what you think of him. Suppose
some day Hilda learns what you think of him?</p>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. I think very well of him and you know it. Of course, I dread the
time when she marries him, but I wouldn't for the world have her think
that we speak disrespectfully of her or her friends.</p>

<p>B<small>OB</small>. [<i>Taking out his cigarette case and lighting a cigarette.</i>] Mollie,
I see you're strong for the Constitution of the United States.</p>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. [<i>Suspiciously.</i>] What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>B<small>OB</small>. The Constitution says: "Whereas it is a self-evident truth that all

personage Hilda is.</p>

Your remarks don't influence me in the least&mdash;not in the least!</p>

don't they get married? Do you know that?</p>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. All I know is that they are waiting until his business is
entirely successful, so that Hilda won't have to work.</p>

<p>B<small>OB</small>. Well, the Swedes are pretty careful of their money. The chances are
Hilda has a neat little nest-egg laid by.</p>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. [<i>Hesitating and doubtfully.</i>] That's one thing that worries me
a little. I think Hilda puts money&mdash;into&mdash;into&mdash;into the young man's
business.</p>

<p>B<small>OB</small>. [<i>Indignantly.</i>] Do you mean to tell me that this girl gives her
money to that fellow and you don't try to find out a thing about him?
Who he is or what he does? I suppose she supports the loafer.</p>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. [<i>With dignity.</i>] He's not a loafer. I've seen him and I've
talked with him, and I know he's a gentleman.</p>

<p>B<small>OB</small>. Mollie, I'm getting tired of all that kind of drivel. I<a name="page_314" id="page_314"></a> believe
nowadays women give a good deal more thought to pleasing their maids
than they do to pleasing their husbands.</p>

<p>M<small>OLLIE</small>. [<i>Demurely.</i>] Well, you know, Bob, your maid can leave you much

<p class="cb"><a name="DAVID_PINSKI" id="DAVID_PINSKI"></a>DAVID PINSKI</p>

<p>David Pinski, perhaps the most notable dramatist of the Yiddish Theatre,
was born of Jewish parentage April 5, 1872, in Mohilev, on the Dnieper,
White Russia. Because his parents had rabbinical aspirations for him he
was well educated in Hebrew studies (Bible and Talmud) by his fourteenth
year, when he moved to Moscow, where he was further trained in classical
and secular studies. In 1891 he planned to study medicine in Vienna, but
soon returned to Warsaw, where he began his literary work as a
short-story writer. In 1896 he took up the study of philosophy and
literature, and in 1899 wrote his first plays. In 1899 he came to New
York City, where he is now editor of the Jewish daily, <i>Die Zeit</i>. In
1911 he revisited Germany to see a production of his well-known comedy,
<i>The Treasure</i>, by Max Reinhart.</p>

<p>Mr. Pinski is zealous in his interests in literature, drama, socialism,
and Zionism. Drama is to him an interpretation of life, and a guide and
leader, as were the words of the old poets and prophets. "The dramatic
technique," says he, "changes with each plot, as each plot brings with
it its own technique. One thing, however, must be common to all the
different forms of the dramatic technique&mdash;avoidance of tediousness."</p>

<p>Mr. Pinski has written a goodly number of plays, most of which are on
Yiddish themes. <i>Forgotten Souls</i>, <i>The Stranger</i>, <i>Sufferings</i>, <i>The
Treasure</i>, <i>The Phonograph</i>, and <i>A Dollar</i> may be mentioned. Most of
his plays have been produced many times; <i>The Stranger</i> played the third
season in Moscow.</p>

<p>"I wrote <i>A Dollar</i>," says he, "in the summer of 1913, when I was hard
pressed financially. I relieved myself of my feelings by a hearty laugh
at the almighty dollar and the race for it. Just as I did many summers
before, in 1906, when I entertained myself by ridiculing the mad money
joy in the bigger comedy, <i>The Treasure</i>."<a name="page_324" id="page_324"></a></p>

to right; the other crosses the first diagonally, disappearing into
the forest. The roadside is bordered with grass. On the right, at
the crossing, stands a sign-post, to which are nailed two boards,
giving directions and distances.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>The afternoon of a summer day. A troupe of stranded strolling

way it is thirty-six. Now choose for yourself the town that you'll never

crowned our histrionic successes.</p>

<p>Beulah Bornstead, one of the promising young playwrights of the
Northwest, was born in Grand Forks, North Dakota, May 5, 1896. She has
had her academic training at the University of North Dakota, from which
she received her B.A. in 1921. At present Miss Bornstead is principal of
the Cavalier High School, North Dakota. Before attempting drama she
tried her hand at journalism and at short-story writing.</p>

<p>Miss Bornstead was introduced into playwriting by Professor Franz
Rickaby, in whose course in dramatic composition at the University of
North Dakota <i>The Diabolical Circle</i> was written. In speaking of this
play Miss Bornstead writes: "<i>The Diabolical Circle</i> is the first play I
have ever written. I never enjoyed doing anything so much in my life.
The characters were so real to me that if I had bumped into one going
round the corner I should not have been surprised in the least. <span class="smcap">Betty</span>
and <span class="smcap">Charles</span> and <span class="smcap">Adonijah</span> and even <span class="smcap">Cotton Mather</span> himself worked that play
out. All the humble author did was to set it down on paper." <i>The
Diabolical Circle</i> was produced May 5, 1921, by the Dakota Playmakers in
their Little Theatre at the University of North Dakota.</p>

<p><i>The Diabolical Circle</i> is one of the best contemporary plays dealing
with American historical material. Its characterization is one of its
noteworthy elements.<a name="page_346" id="page_346"></a></p>

<p class="hang">SCENE: <i>The living-room in the Mather home in Boston.</i></p>

<p class="hang">TIME: <i>About 1700, an evening in early autumn.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>The stage represents the living-room of the Mather home. A large
colonial fireplace is seen down-stage left, within which stand huge
brass andirons. To one side hangs the bellows, with the tongs near
by, while above, underneath the mantelpiece, is suspended an old
flint-lock rifle. On both ends of the mantel are brass
candlesticks, and hanging directly above is an old-fashioned
portrait of Betty's mother. There are two doors, one leading into
the hall at centre left, the other, communicating with the rest of
the house, up-stage right. A straight high-backed settee is
down-stage right, while in the centre back towers an old
grandfather's clock.<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> To the left of the clock is the window,
cross-barred and draped with flowered chintz. An old-fashioned
table occupies the corner between the window and the hall door.
Here and there are various straight-backed chairs of Dutch origin.
Rag rugs cover the floor.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>As the curtain rises</i> <span class="smcap">Cotton Mather</span> <i>is seated in a large armchair
by the fire, with</i> <span class="smcap">Betty</span> <i>on a stool at his feet, with her
knitting</i>.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Cotton</span>, <i>his hair already touched with the whitening frost of many
a severe New England winter, is grave and sedate. Very much
exercised with the perils of this life, and serenely contemplative
of the life to come, he takes himself and the world about him very
seriously.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Not so with</i> <span class="smcap">Mistress Betty</span>. <i>Outwardly demure, yet inwardly<a name="page_348" id="page_348"></a>
rebellious against the straitened conventions of the times, she
dimples over with roguish merriment upon the slightest
provocation.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>As we first see them</i> <span class="smcap">Cotton</span> <i>is giving</i> <span class="smcap">Betty</span> <i>some timely
advice</i>.</p>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. But you must understand that marriage, my daughter, is a most
reverend and serious matter which should be approached in a manner
fittingly considerate of its grave responsibility.</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. [<i>Thoughtfully.</i>] Truly reverend and most serious, father
[<i>looking up roguishly</i>], but I like not so much of the grave about it.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. [<i>Continuing.</i>] I fear thou lookest upon the matter too lightly.
It is not seemly to treat such a momentous occasion thus flippantly.</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. [<i>Protesting.</i>] Nay, father, why consider it at all? Marriage is
yet a great way off. Mayhap I shall never leave thee.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. Thou little thinkest that I may be suddenly called on to leave
<i>thee</i>. The Good Word cautions us to boast not ourselves of the morrow,
for we know not what a day may bring forth.</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. [<i>Dropping her knitting.</i>] Father, thou art not feeling well.
Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. Nay, child, be not alarmed. 'Tis but a most necessary lesson to
be learned and laid up in the heart. I will not always be with thee and
I would like to be comfortably assured of thy future welfare before I
go.</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. [<i>Picking her knitting up.</i>] Be comfortably assured, then, I
prithee; I have no fears.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. [<i>Bringing his arm down forcibly on the arm of the chair.</i>] Aye!
There it is. Thou hast no fears. Would that thou had'st some! [<i>Looks up
at the portrait.</i>] Had thy prudent and virtuous mother only lived to
point the way, I might be<a name="page_349" id="page_349"></a> spared this anxiety; but, beset by diverse
difficulties in establishing the kingdom of God in this country, and
sorely harassed by many hardships and by evil men, I fear me I have not
propounded to thee much that I ought.</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. In what then is mine education lacking? Have I not all that is
fitting and proper for a maiden to know?</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. [<i>Perplexed.</i>] I know not. I have done my best, but thou hast
not the proper attitude of mind befitting a maiden about to enter the
married estate.</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. [<i>Protesting.</i>] Nay, but I am not about to enter the married
estate.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. It is time.</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. [<i>Mockingly pleading.</i>] Entreat me not to leave thee, father, nor
forsake thee; for whither thou goest I will go, and whither&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. [<i>Interrupting sternly.</i>] Betty! It ill befitteth a daughter of
mine to quote the Scriptures with such seeming irreverence.&mdash;I would not
be parted from thee, yet I would that thou wert promised to some godly
and upright soul that would guide thee yet more surely in the paths of
righteousness. There be many such.</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. Yea, too many.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. What meanest thou?</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. One were one too many when I would have none.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. [<i>Shaking his head.</i>] Ah. Betty, Betty! When wilt thou be
serious? There is a goodly youth among the friends surrounding thee whom
I have often marked, both on account of his godly demeanor and simple
wisdom.</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. [<i>Nodding.</i>] Yea, simple.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. I speak of Adonijah Wigglesworth, a most estimable young
gentleman, an acquaintance whom thou would'st do well to cultivate.</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. Yea, cultivate.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. What thinkest thou?<a name="page_350" id="page_350"></a></p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. A sod too dense for any ploughshare. My wit would break in the
turning.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. His is a strong nature, born to drive and not be driven. There
is not such another, nay, not in the whole of Boston.</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. Nay. I have lately heard there be many such!</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. [<i>Testily.</i>] Mayhap thou wouldst name a few.</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. [<i>Musingly, holds up her left hand with fingers outspread.</i>] Aye,
that I can. [<i>Checks off one on the little finger.</i>] There be Marcus
Ainslee&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. A goodly youth that hath an eye for books.</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. One eye, sayest thou? Nay, four; and since I am neither morocco
bound nor edged with gilt, let us consign him to the shelf wherein he
findeth fullest compensation.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. How now? A man of action, then, should appeal to thy brash
tastes. What sayest thou to Jeremiah Wadsworth?</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. Too brash and rash for me [<i>checking off that candidate on the
next finger</i>], and I'll have none of him. There's Percy Wayne.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. Of the bluest blood in Boston.</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. Yet that be not everything [<i>checks off another finger</i>]&mdash;and
Jonas Appleby&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. He hath an eye to worldly goods&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. [<i>Quickly.</i>] Especially the larder. To marry him would be an
everlasting round between the tankard and the kettle. [<i>Checks him
off.</i>] Nay, let me look yet farther&mdash;James Endicott. [<i>Checking.</i>]</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. Aye, there might be a lad for thee; birth, breeding, a
well-favored countenance, and most agreeable.</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. Yea, most agreeable&mdash;unto himself. 'Twere a pity to disturb such
unanimity. Therefore, let us pass on. Take Charles Manning, an you
please&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. It pleaseth me not! I know the ilk; his father before<a name="page_351" id="page_351"></a> him a
devoted servant of the devil and King Charles. With others of his kind
he hath brought dissension among the young men of Harvard, many of whom
are dedicated to the service of the Lord, with his wicked apparel and
ungodly fashion of wearing long hair after the manner of Russians and
barbarous Indians. Many there be with him brought up in such pride as
doth in no ways become the service of the Lord. The devil himself hath
laid hold on our young men, so that they do evaporate senseless,
useless, noisy impertinency wherever they may be; and now it has e'en
got out in the pulpits of the land, to the great grief and fear of many
godly hearts.</p>

<p class="r">[<i>He starts to his feet and paces the floor.</i></p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. [<i>Standing upright.</i>] But Charles&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. [<i>Interrupting.</i>] Mention not that scapegrace in my hearing.</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. [<i>Still persisting.</i>] But, father, truly thou knowest not&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. [<i>Almost savagely, while</i> <span class="smcap">Betty</span> <i>retreats to a safe distance</i>.]
Name him not. I will not have it. Compared with Adonijah he is a reed
shaken in the winds, whereas Adonijah resembleth a tree planted by the
river of waters.</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. [<i>Who has been looking out of the window.</i>] Converse of the devil
and thou wilt behold his horns. Even now he approacheth the knocker.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The knocker sounds.</i></p></div>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. [<i>Sternly.</i>] Betake thyself to thine own chamber with thine
unseemly tongue, which so ill befitteth a maid.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Betty</span> <i>is very demure, with head slightly bent and downcast eyes;
but the moment</i> <span class="smcap">Cotton</span> <i>turns she glances roguishly after his
retreating form; then while her glance revolves about the room, she
starts slightly as her gaze falls upon the clock. A smile of
mischievous delight flits over her countenance as she tiptoes in</i>
<span class="smcap">Cotton's</span> <i>wake until the clock is reached</i>. <span class="smcap">Cotton</span>, <i>unsuspecting,
meanwhile, proceeds<a name="page_352" id="page_352"></a> to do his duty as host, with never a backward
glance. While he is out in the hall</i> <span class="smcap">Betty,</span> <i>with a lingering smile
of triumph, climbs into the clock and cautiously peeks forth as her
father opens the door and ushers in</i> <span class="smcap">Adonijah</span>, <i>whereupon the door
softly closes</i>.</p></div>

<p>A<small>DONIJAH</small>. Good-morrow, reverend sir.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. Enter, and doubly welcome.</p>

<p>A<small>DONIJAH</small>. I would inquire whether thy daughter Betty is within.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. We were but speaking of thee as thy knock sounded. Betty will be
here presently; she hath but retired for the moment. Remove thy wraps
and make thyself in comfort.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Adonijah</span> <i>is a lean, lank, lantern-jawed individual, clad in the
conventional sober gray of the Puritan, with high-crowned hat, and

them upon the table; meanwhile</i> <span class="smcap">Adonijah</span> <i>looks appraisingly about
him and judiciously selects the armchair by the fire. He pauses a
moment to rub his hands before the blaze, and then gingerly relaxes

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. And how is it with thee since I have seen thee last?</p>

<p>A<small>DONIJAH</small>. My business prospereth [<i>mournfully</i>], but not so finely as it
might well do.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The clock strikes four, but is unnoticed by the two men.</i></p></div>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. Thou hast suffered some great loss?</p>

<p>A<small>DONIJAH</small>. But yes&mdash;and no&mdash;this matter of lending money hath many and
grievous complications, not the least of which is the duplicity of the
borrower. I but insist on the thirty pounds to the hundred as my due
recompense, and when I demand it<a name="page_353" id="page_353"></a> they respond not, but let my kindness
lie under the clods of ingratitude. [<i>Straightening up, and speaking
with conviction.</i>] They shall come before the council. I will have what
is mine own.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. [<i>Righteously.</i>] And it is not unbecoming of thee to demand it.
I wist not what the present generation is coming to.</p>

<p>A<small>DONIJAH</small>. They have no sense of the value of money. They know not how to
demean themselves properly in due proportion to their worldly goods, as
the Lord hath prospered them. There be many that have nothing and do
hold their heads above us that be worthy of our possessions.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. The wicked stand in slippery places. It will not always be thus.
Judgment shall come upon them.</p>

<p>A<small>DONIJAH</small>. Aye, let them fall. I for one have upheld them too far. They
squander their means in riotous living, and walk not in the ways of
their fathers.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. There be many such&mdash;many such&mdash;but thou, my lad, thou art not
one of the multitude. As I have often observed to my Betty, thou
standest out as a most upright and God-fearing young man.</p>

<p>A<small>DONIJAH</small>. [<i>Brimming over with self-satisfaction.</i>] That have I ever
sought to be.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. An example that others would do well to imitate.</p>

<p>A<small>DONIJAH</small>. [<i>All puffed up.</i>] Nay, others value it not. They be envious
of my good fortune.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. A most prudent young man! Nay, be not so over-blushingly timid.
Thou'rt too modest.</p>

<p>A<small>DONIJAH</small>. [<i>His face falling.</i>] But Betty&mdash;doth she regard me thus?</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. The ways of a maid are past finding out; but despair not. I
think she hath thee much to heart, but, as the perverse heart of woman
dictateth, behaveth much to the contrary.<a name="page_354" id="page_354"></a></p>

<p>A<small>DONIJAH</small>. [<i>Brightening up as one with new hopes.</i>] Thou thinkest&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. [<i>Interrupting.</i>] Nay, lad, I am sure of it. Betty was ever a
dutiful daughter.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>All unseen</i>, <span class="smcap">Betty</span> <i>peeks out mischievously</i>.</p></div>

<p>A<small>DONIJAH</small>. But I mistrust me her heart is elsewhere.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. Thou referr'st to young Manning without doubt. It can never be.
'Tis but a passing fancy.</p>

<p>A<small>DONIJAH</small>. Nay, but I fear Charles thinketh not so. I have been told in
secret [<i>leaning forward confidentially</i>] by one that hath every
opportunity to know, that he hath enjoined Goodman Shrewsbury to send
for&mdash;[<i>impressively</i>] a ring!</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. [<i>Angered.</i>] A ring, sayest thou?</p>

<p>A<small>DONIJAH</small>. [<i>Nodding.</i>] Aye, even so.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. But he hath not signified such intention here to me.</p>

<p>A<small>DONIJAH</small>. Then there are no grounds for his rash presumption?</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. Humph! Grounds! For a ring! Aye, there'll be no diabolical
circle here for the devil to daunce in. I will question Betty thereon.
[<i>Rises.</i>] Do thou remain here and I will send her to thee. Oh, that he
should offer daughter of mine a ring!</p>

about me is askew. Whence came she here? [<i>Points at</i> <span class="smcap">Betty</span>.] She
neither came nor went, and yet she was not there and now she is. A manly
form did enter. Yet hath vanished into thin air. Yea, verily, it was
none other than the devil himself in one of his divers forms, of which
he hath aplenty. The very clock indulgeth in unseemly pranks. A strange
influence hangs over me. I cannot now abide. I must depart from hence.

diabolical circles the devil may invent or his helpmeets acquire will be
of small avail when the leaping tongues<a name="page_362" id="page_362"></a> of flame curl round you, false

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. [<i>Hotly.</i>] Aye&mdash;let them! [<i>Then starting suddenly with a new

did'st materialize out of thin air.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Surveys</i> <span class="smcap">Charles</span> <i>with piercing scrutiny</i>.</p></div>

<p>C<small>HARLES</small>. Nay, see through me an thou can'st. Thou wilt find me a most
material shadow, the like of which no eye hath ever pierced. 'Twas not
out of the air, but out of yonder clock that I materialized.</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. Yea, father, I put him there.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. [<i>Going to the clock and opening it.</i>] Of a truth, the<a name="page_363" id="page_363"></a>
evidence, all told, is here. Thou wert of a certainty in the clock.
[<i>Takes out the detached pendulum. Steps back and surveys the timepiece,
whose hands clearly indicate a time long passed or not yet come.</i>] And
as far as pendulums are concerned [<i>looking ruefully at the one in his
hand</i>], thou certainly wert no improve&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>C<small>HARLES</small>. Aye, that I'll warrant. And may I never more be called to
fulfil such position; the requirements be far too exacting for one of my
build and constitution.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. But what extremity hath induced thee to take up thine abode in
such a place?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Lays the pendulum aside and gives</i> <span class="smcap">Charles</span> <i>his entire
attention</i>.</p></div>

<p>C<small>HARLES</small>. Why, that came all in the course of events as I take it. When I
returned a short time ago, hard upon mine heels came Adonijah; and,
being loath either to leave the field or share it, I hid within the
clock. Once there, the temptation to help time in covering its course
grew strong upon me in the hope that Adonijah, misled by the lateness of
the hour, would soon depart. Only I looked not for such a departure.
Judge me not too harshly, sire, for I love thy daughter, and if thou
wilt give thy consent to our marriage I will do all that becometh a man
to deserve such treasure.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. I like not thy frivolous manner of wearing hair that is not
thine own; it becomes thee not. And I strongly mistrust thine attitude
toward the more serious things of life.</p>

<p>C<small>HARLES</small>. If my wig standeth between me and my heart's desire, why, I'll
have no wig at all. [<i>He pulls the wig off and tosses it aside.</i> <span class="smcap">Betty</span>,
<i>with a little cry, picks it up and smooths its disarranged curls</i>.] And
as for mine outlook on life, I promise thee that hath but matched the
outer trappings, and can be doffed as quickly. I am as serious beneath
all outward levity as any sober-minded judge, and can act accordingly.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. See to it that thou suit the action to those words. My heart is
strangely moved toward thee, yet I would ponder<a name="page_364" id="page_364"></a> the matter more deeply.
[<i>Turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Betty</span>, <i>who has been absent-mindedly twirling the curls on
the wig</i>.] And where is thy voice, my daughter? Thou art strangely
silent&mdash;[<i>as an afterthought</i>] for the once. But it is of small wonder,
since thou hast had enough excitement for one evening. Methinks that
scoundrel, Adonijah, needeth following up. Do thou remain with Betty,
Charles, and I will hasten after him.</p>

<p>C<small>HARLES</small>. Nay, thou need'st not trouble thyself regarding Adonijah. He
hath much too wholesome a regard for the ducking-stool to cause further
mischief.</p>

<p>C<small>OTTON</small>. Nevertheless, I will away to the council and make sure. [<i>He
plants his hat on his head and departs.</i></p>

<p>C<small>HARLES</small>. [<i>Turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Betty</span>, <i>who has dropped the wig on the settee,
and who is now gazing demurely at the floor</i>.] And now to finish up
where we left off. The devil hath led us a merrier dance than we
suspected. Thou hast not truly given answer to the question I have asked
of thee.</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. What more of an answer would'st thou yet require?</p>

<p>C<small>HARLES</small>. Why, I have yet had none at all.</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. Must tell thee further?</p>

<p>C<small>HARLES</small>. [<i>Gravely.</i>] Thou must.</p>

<p>B<small>ETTY</small>. [<i>Mischievously.</i>] Then&mdash;put the question once again.</p>

<p>C<small>HARLES</small>. Thou knowest the question, an thou wilt.</p>

dramatists, was born at Matziken, in East Prussia, Germany, September
30, 1857. He attended school at Elbing and Tilsit, and then at fourteen
became a druggist's apprentice. He received his university training at
Königsberg and Berlin. Soon he devoted his energies to literary work.</p>

<p>His greatest literary work is in the field of the drama, in which he
became successful almost instantly. His strength is not in poetic beauty
and in deep insight into human character, as in the instance of a number
of other German dramatists. He is essentially a man of the theatre, a
dramatist, and a technician by instinct. He is a dramatic craftsman of
the first order.</p>

<p>His chief one-act plays are in two volumes: <i>Morituri</i>, which contains
<i>Teja</i>, <i>Fritchen</i>, and <i>The Eternal Masculine</i>; and <i>Roses</i>, which
contains <i>Streaks of Light</i>, <i>Margot</i>, <i>The Last Visit</i>, and <i>The
Far-Away Princess</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Far-Away Princess</i> is one of the most subtle and most delicate of
Sudermann's plays. Its technic is exemplary.<a name="page_368" id="page_368"></a></p>

<p class="hang">THE PRESENT DAY: <i>The scene is laid at an inn situated above a
watering-place in central Germany.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>The veranda of an inn. The right side of the stage and half of the
background represent a framework of glass enclosing the veranda.
The left side and the other half of the background represent the
stone walls of the house. To the left, in the foreground, a door;
another door in the background, at the left. On the left, back, a
buffet and serving-table. Neat little tables and small iron chairs
for visitors are placed about the veranda. On the right, in the
centre, a large telescope, standing on a tripod, is directed
through an open window.</i> <span class="smcap">Rosa</span>, <i>dressed in the costume of the

<i>a handsome, stoutish woman in the thirties, hurries in excitedly

<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>F<small>RAU</small> L<small>INDEMANN</small>. There! Now she can come&mdash;curtains, bedding&mdash;everything
fresh and clean as new! No, this honor, this unexpected honor&mdash;! Barons
and counts have been here often enough. Even the Russian princes
sometimes come up from the Springs. I don't bother my head about
them&mdash;they're just like&mdash;that!&mdash;But a princess&mdash;a real princess!</p>

<p>R<small>OSA</small>. Perhaps it isn't a real princess after all.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU</small> L<small>INDEMANN</small>. [<i>Indignantly.</i>] What? What do you mean by that!</p>

<p>R<small>OSA</small>. I was only thinking that a real princess wouldn't be coming to an
inn like this. Real princesses won't lie on anything but silks and
velvets. You just wait and see; it's a trick!<a name="page_370" id="page_370"></a></p>

<p>F<small>RAU</small> L<small>INDEMANN</small>. Are you going to pretend that the letter isn't genuine;
that the letter is a forgery?</p>

<p>R<small>OSA</small>. Maybe one of the regular customers is playing a joke. That
student, Herr Strübel, he's always joking. [<i>Giggles.</i></p>

<p>F<small>RAU</small> L<small>INDEMANN</small>. When Herr Strübel makes a joke he makes a decent joke, a
real, genuine joke. Oh, of course one has to pretend to be angry
sometimes&mdash;but as for writing a forged letter&mdash;My land!&mdash;a letter with a
gold crown on it&mdash;there! [<i>She takes a letter from her waist and
reads.</i>] "This afternoon Her Highness, the Princess von Geldern, will
stop at the Fairview Inn, to rest an hour or so before making the
descent to the Springs. You are requested to have ready a quiet and
comfortable room, to guard Her Highness from any annoying advances, and,
above all, to maintain the strictest secrecy regarding this event, as
otherwise the royal visit will not be repeated. Baroness von Brook, maid
of honor to Her Highness." Now, what have you got to say?</p>

<p>R<small>OSA</small>. Herr Strübel lent me a book once. A maid of honor came into that,
too. I'm sure it's a trick!</p>

<p>F<small>RAU</small> L<small>INDEMANN</small>. [<i>Looking out toward the back.</i>] Dear, dear, isn't that
Herr Strübel now, coming up the hill? To-day of all days! What on earth
does he always want up here?</p>

<p>R<small>OSA</small>. [<i>Pointedly.</i>] He's in such favor at the Inn. He won't be leaving
here all day.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU</small> L<small>INDEMANN</small>. That won't do at all. He's got to be sent off. If I only
knew how I could&mdash;Oh, ho! I'll be disagreeable to him&mdash;that's the only
way to manage it!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Strübel</span> <i>enters. He is a handsome young fellow without much
polish, but cheerful, unaffected, entirely at his ease, and
invariably good-natured.</i></p></div>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Good day, everybody.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU</small> L<small>INDEMANN</small>. [<i>Sarcastically.</i>] Charming day.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. [<i>Surprised at her coolness.</i>] I say! What's up? Who's been
rubbing you the wrong way? May I have a glass<a name="page_371" id="page_371"></a> of beer, anyway? Glass of
beer, if you please! Several glasses of beer, if you please. [<i>Sits
down.</i>] Pestiferously hot this afternoon.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU</small> L<small>INDEMANN</small>. [<i>After a pause.</i>] H'm, H'm.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Landlady Linda, dear, why so quiet to-day?</p>

<p>F<small>RAU</small> L<small>INDEMANN</small>. In the first place, Herr Strübel, I would have you know
that my name is Frau Lindemann.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Just so.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU</small> L<small>INDEMANN</small>. And, secondly, if you don't stop your familiarity&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. [<i>Singing, as</i> <span class="smcap">Rosa</span> <i>brings him a glass of beer</i>.]
"Beer&mdash;beer!"&mdash;Heavens and earth, how hot it is! [<i>Drinks.</i></p>

<p>F<small>RAU</small> L<small>INDEMANN</small>. If you find it so hot, why don't you stay quietly down
there at the Springs?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Ah, my soul thirsts for the heights&mdash;my soul thirsts for the
heights every afternoon. Just as soon as ever my sallow-faced pupil has
thrown himself down on the couch to give his red corpuscles a chance to
grow, "I gayly grasp my Alpine staff and mount to my beloved."</p>

<p>F<small>RAU</small> L<small>INDEMANN</small>. [<i>Scornfully.</i>] Bah!</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Oh, you're thinking that <i>you</i> are my beloved? No, dearest; my
beloved stays down there. But to get nearer to her, I have to come up
here&mdash;up to your telescope. With the aid of your telescope I can look
right into her window&mdash;see?</p>

<p>R<small>OSA</small>. [<i>Laughing.</i>] Oh, so that's why&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>F<small>RAU</small> L<small>INDEMANN</small>. Perhaps you think I'm interested in all that? Besides,
I've no more time for you. Moreover, I'm going to have this place
cleaned right away. Good-by, Herr Strübel. [<i>Goes out.</i></p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. [<i>Laughing.</i>] I certainly caught it that time! See here, Rosa,
what's got into her head?</p>

<p>R<small>OSA</small>. [<i>Mysteriously.</i>] Ahem, there are crowned heads and other
heads&mdash;and&mdash;ahem&mdash;there are letters <i>with</i> crowns and letters <i>without</i>
crowns.<a name="page_372" id="page_372"></a></p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Letters&mdash;? Are you&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>R<small>OSA</small>. There are maids of honor&mdash;and other maids! [<i>Giggles.</i></p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Permit me. [<i>Tapping her forehead lightly with his finger.</i>]
Ow! Ow!</p>

<p>R<small>OSA</small>. What's the matter?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Why, your head's on fire. Blow! Blow! And while you are getting
some salve for my burns, I'll just&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="r">[<i>Goes to the telescope.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Frau von Halldorf</span>, <span class="smcap">Liddy</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Milly</span>. <span class="smcap">Frau von Halldorf</span>
<i>is an aristocratic woman, somewhat supercilious and affected</i>.</p></div>

<p>L<small>IDDY</small>. Here's the telescope, mother. Now you can see for yourself.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. H<small>ALLDORF</small>. What a pity that it's in use just now.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. [<i>Stepping back.</i>] Oh, I beg of you, ladies&mdash;I have plenty of
time. I can wait.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. H<small>ALLDORF</small>. [<i>Condescendingly.</i>] Ah, thanks so much. [<i>She goes up
to the telescope, while</i> <span class="smcap">Strübel</span> <i>returns to his former place</i>.]
Waitress! Bring us three glasses of milk.</p>

<p>L<small>IDDY</small>. [<i>As</i> <span class="smcap">Milly</span> <i>languidly drops into a chair</i>.] Beyond to the right
is the road, mother.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. H<small>ALLDORF</small>. Oh, I have found the road, but I see no
carriage&mdash;neither a royal carriage nor any other sort.</p>

<p>L<small>IDDY</small>. Let me look.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. H<small>ALLDORF</small>. Please do.</p>

<p>L<small>IDDY</small>. It has disappeared now.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. H<small>ALLDORF</small>. Are you quite sure that it was a royal carriage?</p>

<p>L<small>IDDY</small>. Oh, one has an instinct for that sort of thing, mother. It comes
to one in the cradle.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. H<small>ALLDORF</small>. [<i>As</i> <span class="smcap">Milly</span> <i>yawns and sighs aloud</i>.] Are you sleepy,
dear?</p>

<p>M<small>ILLY</small>. No, only tired. I'm always tired.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. H<small>ALLDORF</small>. Well, that's just why we are at the<a name="page_373" id="page_373"></a> Springs. Do as
the princess does: take the waters religiously.</p>

<p>M<small>ILLY</small>. The princess oughtn't to be climbing up such a steep hill either
on a hot day like this.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. H<small>ALLDORF</small>. [<i>More softly.</i>] Well, you know why we are taking all
this trouble. If, by good luck, we should happen to meet the
princess&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>L<small>IDDY</small>. [<i>Who has been looking through the telescope.</i>] Oh, there it is
again!</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. H<small>ALLDORF</small>. [<i>Eagerly.</i>] Where? Where?</p>

<p class="r">[<i>Takes</i> <span class="smcap">Liddy's</span> <i>place</i>.</p>

<p>L<small>IDDY</small>. It's just coming around the turn at the top.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. H<small>ALLDORF</small>. Oh, now I see it! Why, there's no one inside!</p>

<p>L<small>IDDY</small>. Well, then she's coming up on foot.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. H<small>ALLDORF</small>. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Milly</span>.] See, the princess is coming up on foot,
too. And she is just as anæmic as you are.</p>

<p>M<small>ILLY</small>. If I were going to marry a grand-duke, and if I could have my own
carriage driven along beside me, I wouldn't complain of having to walk
either.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. H<small>ALLDORF</small>. I can't see a thing now.</p>

<p>L<small>IDDY</small>. You have to turn the screw, mother.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. H<small>ALLDORF</small>. I have been turning it right along, but the telescope
won't move.</p>

<p>L<small>IDDY</small>. Let me try.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. [<i>Who has been throwing little wads of paper at</i> <span class="smcap">Rosa</span> <i>during
the preceding conversation</i>.] What are they up to?</p>

<p>L<small>IDDY</small>. It seems to me that you've turned the screw too far, mother.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. H<small>ALLDORF</small>. Well, what shall we do about it?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. [<i>Rising.</i>] Permit me to come to your aid, ladies. I've had
some experience with these old screws.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. H<small>ALLDORF</small>. Very kind&mdash;indeed.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Strübel</span> <i>busies himself with the instrument</i>.</p></div>

<p>L<small>IDDY</small>. Listen, mother. If the carriage has almost reached<a name="page_374" id="page_374"></a> the top the
princess can't be far off. Wouldn't it be best, then, to watch for them
on the road?</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. H<small>ALLDORF</small>. Certainly, if you think that would be best, dear
Liddy.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. This is not only an old screw, but it's a regular perverted old
screw.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. H<small>ALLDORF</small>. Ah, really? [<i>Aside to her daughters.</i>] And if she
should actually speak to us at this accidental meeting&mdash;and if we could
present ourselves as the subjects of her noble fiancé, and tell her that
we live at her future home&mdash;just imagine what an advantage that would
give us over the other women of the court!</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. There, ladies! We have now rescued the useful instrument to
which the far-sightedness of mankind is indebted.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. H<small>ALLDORF</small>. Thanks, so much. Pardon me, sir, but have you heard
anything about the report that the princess is going to make the journey
up here to-day?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. The princess? The princess of the Springs? The princess of the
lonely villa? The princess who is expected at the iron spring every
morning, but who has never been seen by a living soul? Why, I am
enormously interested. You wouldn't believe how much interested I am!</p>

<p>L<small>IDDY</small>. [<i>Who has looked out, back.</i>] There&mdash;there&mdash;there&mdash;it is!</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. H<small>ALLDORF</small>. The carriage?</p>

<p>L<small>IDDY</small>. It's reached the top already. It is stopping over there at the
edge of the woods.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. H<small>ALLDORF</small>. She will surely enter it there, then. Come quickly, my
dear children, so that it will look quite accidental. Here is your
money. [<i>She throws a coin to</i> <span class="smcap">Rosa</span> <i>and unwraps a small package done up
in tissue-paper, which she has brought with her</i>.] Here is a bouquet for
you&mdash;and here's one for you. You are to present these to the princess.</p>

<p>M<small>ILLY</small>. So that it will look quite accidental&mdash;oh, yes!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>All three go out.</i></p></div>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Good heavens! Could I&mdash;? I don't believe it! Surely she
sits&mdash;well, I'll make sure right away&mdash;[<i>Goes up to the telescope and
stops.</i>] Oh, I'll go along with them, anyhow.</p>

<p class="r">[<i>Exit after them.</i></p>

<p>F<small>RAU</small> L<small>INDEMANN</small>. [<i>Entering.</i>] Have they all gone&mdash;all of them?</p>

<p>R<small>OSA</small>. All of them.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU</small> L<small>INDEMANN</small>. [<i>Looking toward the right.</i>] There&mdash;there&mdash;two ladies
and a lackey are coming up the footpath. Mercy me! How my heart is
beating!&mdash;If I had only had the sofa recovered last spring!&mdash;What am I
going to say to them?&mdash;Rosa, don't you know a poem by heart which you
could speak to the princess? [<span class="smcap">Rosa</span> <i>shrugs her shoulders</i>.] They're
coming through the court now!&mdash;Stop putting your arms under your apron
that way, you stupid thing!&mdash;oh dear, oh dear&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The door opens.</i> <span class="smcap">A Lackey</span> <i>in plain black livery enters, and

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. B<small>ROOK</small>. Edward, order what is needed for Her Highness, and see
that a room next to Her Highness is prepared<a name="page_376" id="page_376"></a> for me. I may assume that
these are Your Highness's wishes?</p>

M'envoyer coucher comme une enfant, c'est abominable.</p>

nothing but your illness&mdash;that reminds me, you haven't taken your
peptonized milk yet&mdash;this is a secret which we must keep from every one,
above all from your fiancé. If the Grand Duke should discover&mdash;&mdash;<a name="page_377" id="page_377"></a></p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. [<i>Shrugging her shoulders.</i>] Well, what of it?</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. B<small>ROOK</small>. A bride's duty is to be a happy bride. Otherwise&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Otherwise?</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. B<small>ROOK</small>. She will be a lonely and an unloved woman.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. [<i>With a little smile of resignation.</i>] Ah!</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. B<small>ROOK</small>. What is it, dear? [<span class="smcap">The Princess</span> <i>shakes her head</i>.] And
then think of the strain of those formal presentations awaiting you in
the autumn! You must grow strong. Remember that you must be equal to the
most exacting demands of life.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Of life? Whose life?</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. B<small>ROOK</small>. What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Ah, what good does it do to talk about it?</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. B<small>ROOK</small>. Yes, you are right. In my soul, too, there are unhappy
and unholy thoughts that I would rather not utter. From my own
experience I know that it is best to keep strictly within the narrow
path of duty.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. And to go to sleep.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. B<small>ROOK</small>. Ah, it isn't only that.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Look out there! See the woods! Ah, to lie down on the
moss, to cover oneself with leaves, to watch the clouds pass by high

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. B<small>ROOK</small>. Is everything ready?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">The Lackey</span> <i>bows</i>.</p></div>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. [<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Frau v. Brook</span>.] But I simply cannot sleep.</p>

<p>F<small>RAU V</small>. B<small>ROOK</small>. Try to, for my sake. [<i>Aloud.</i>] Does Your Highness
command&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. [<i>Smiling and sighing.</i>] Yes, I command.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>They go out, left.</i><a name="page_378" id="page_378"></a></p>

<p>[<i>The stage remains empty for several moments. Then</i> <span class="smcap">Strübel</span> <i>is
heard trying the latch of the back door</i>.</p></div>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL'S </small>V<small>OICE</small>. Hullo! What's up! Why is this locked all of a sudden?
Rosa! Open up! I've got to look through the telescope! Rosa! Won't you?
Oh, well, I know how to help myself. [<i>He is seen walking outside of the
glass-covered veranda. Then he puts his head through the open window at
the right.</i>] Not a soul inside? [<i>Climbs over.</i>] Well, here we are. What
on earth has happened to these people? [<i>Unlocks the back door and looks
out.</i>] Everything deserted. Well, it's all the same to me. [<i>Locks the
door again.</i>] But let's find out right away what the carriage has to do
with the case.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Prepares to look through the telescope.</i> <span class="smcap">The Princess</span> <i>enters
cautiously through the door at the left, her hat in her hand.
Without noticing</i> <span class="smcap">Strübel</span>, <i>who is standing motionless before the
telescope, she goes hurriedly to the door at the back and unlocks
it</i>.</p></div>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. [<i>Startled at the sound of the key, turns around.</i>] Why, how do
you do? [<span class="smcap">The Princess</span>, <i>not venturing to move, glances back at the door
through which she has entered</i>.] Wouldn't you like to look through the
telescope a while? Please do. [<span class="smcap">The Princess</span>, <i>undecided as to whether or
not she should answer him, takes a few steps back toward the door at the
left</i>.] Why are you going away? I won't do anything to you.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. [<i>Reassured.</i>] Oh, I'm not going away.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. That's right. But&mdash;where have you come from? The door was
locked. Surely you didn't climb through the window as I did?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. [<i>Frightened.</i>] What? You came&mdash;through the window?&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Of course I did.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. [<i>Frightened anew.</i>] Then I had rather&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="r">[<i>About to go back.</i></p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Oh, my dear young lady, you just stay right here.<a name="page_379" id="page_379"></a> Why, before
I'd drive you away I'd pitch myself headlong over a precipice!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. [<i>Smiling, reassured.</i>] I only wanted to go out into the
woods for half an hour.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Oh, then you're a regular guest here at the Inn?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. [<i>Quickly.</i>] Yes&mdash;yes, of course.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. And of course you drink the waters down below?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. [<i>In a friendly way.</i>] Oh, yes, I drink the waters. And
I'm taking the baths, too.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Two hundred metres up and down every time! Isn't that very hard
on you? Heavens! And you look so pale! See here, my dear young lady,
don't you do it. It would be better for you to go down there&mdash;that
is&mdash; Oh, forgive me! I've been talking without thinking. Of
course, you have your own reasons&mdash; It's decidedly cheaper up
here. <i>I</i> know how to value a thing of that sort. I've never had any
money in all my life!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. [<i>Trying to seem practical.</i>] But when one comes to a
watering-place, one must have money.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. [<i>Slapping himself on the chest.</i>] Do I look to you as if I
drank iron? Thank Heaven, I can't afford such luxuries! No; I'm only a
poor fellow who earns his miserable pittance during vacation by acting
as a private tutor&mdash;that's to say, "miserable" is only a figure of
speech, for in the morning I lie abed until nine, at noon I eat five and
at night seven courses; and as for work, I really haven't a thing to do!
My pupil is so anæmic&mdash;why, compared to him, <i>you're</i> fit for a circus
rider!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. [<i>Laughing unrestrainedly.</i>] Oh, well, I'm rather glad I'm
not one.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Dear me, it's a business like any other.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Like any other? Really, I didn't think that.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. And pray, what did you think then?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Oh, I thought that they were&mdash;an entirely different sort
of people.<a name="page_380" id="page_380"></a></p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. My dear young lady, all people are "an entirely different
sort." Of course <i>we</i> two aren't. We get along real well together, don't
we? As poor as church mice, both of us!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. [<i>Smiling reflectively.</i>] Who knows? Perhaps that's true.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. [<i>Kindly.</i>] Do you know what? If you want to stay down
there&mdash;I'll tell you how one can live cheaply. I have a friend, a
student like myself. He's here to mend up as you are. I feed him up at
the house where I'm staying. [<i>Frightened at a peculiar look of</i> <span class="smcap">The
Princess's</span>.] Oh, but you mustn't be&mdash;No, I shouldn't have said it. It
wasn't decent of me. Only, let me tell you, I'm so glad to be able to
help the poor fellow out of my unexpected earnings, that I'd like to be
shouting it from the housetops all the time! Of course, you understand
that, don't you?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. You like to help people, then?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Surely&mdash;don't you?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. [<i>Reflecting.</i>] No. There's always so much talk about it,
and the whole thing immediately appears in the newspapers.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. What? If you help some one, that appears&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. [<i>Quietly correcting herself.</i>] I only mean if one takes
part in entertainments for charity&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Oh, yes, naturally. In those things they always get some woman
of rank to act as patroness, if they can, and she sees to it, you may be
sure, that the newspapers make a fuss over it.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. [<i>Demurely.</i>] Oh, not every&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Just try to teach me something I don't know about these titled
women! Besides, my dear young lady, where is your home&mdash;in one of the
large cities, or&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Oh, no. In quite a small town&mdash;really more like the
country.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Then I'm going to show you something that you probably never
saw before in all your life.<a name="page_381" id="page_381"></a></p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Oh do! What is it?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. A princess! H'm&mdash;not a make-believe, but a real, true-blue
princess!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Oh, really?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Yes. Our Princess of the Springs.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. And who may that be?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Why, Princess Marie Louise.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Of Geldern?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Of course.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Do you know her?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Why, certainly.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Really? I thought that she lived in great retirement.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Well, that doesn't do her any good. Not a bit of it. And
because you are such a jolly good fellow I'm going to tell you my
secret. I'm in love with this princess!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Oh!</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. You can't imagine what a comfort it is. The fact is, every
young poet has got to have a princess to love.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Are you a poet?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Can't you tell that by looking at me?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. I never saw a poet before.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Never saw a poet&mdash;never saw a princess! Why, you're learning a
heap of things to-day!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. [<i>Assenting.</i>] H'm&mdash;and have you written poems to her?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Why, that goes without saying! Quantities of 'em!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Oh, please recite some little thing&mdash;won't you?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. No, not yet. Everything at the proper time.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Ah, yes, first I should like to see the princess.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. No, first I am going to tell you the whole story.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Oh, yes, yes. Please do. [<i>Sits down.</i></p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Well, then&mdash;I had hardly heard that she was here<a name="page_382" id="page_382"></a> before I was
dead in love with her. It was just as quick as a shot, I tell you. Just
as if I had waited all my life long to fall in love with her. Besides, I
also heard about her beauty&mdash;and her sorrow. You see, she had an early
love affair.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. [<i>Disconcerted.</i>] What? Are they saying that?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Yes. It was a young officer who went to Africa because of
her&mdash;and died there.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. And they know that, too?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. What don't they know? But that's a mere detail&mdash;it doesn't
concern me. Even the fact that in six months she will become the bride
of a grand-duke&mdash;even that can make no difference to me. For the present
she is <i>my</i> princess. But you're not listening to me!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Oh, yes, I am!</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Do you know what that means&mdash;<i>my</i> princess! I'll not give up
<i>my</i> princess&mdash;not for anything in all the world!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. But&mdash;if you don't even know her&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. I don't know her? Why, I know her as well as I know myself!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Have you ever met her, then?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. I don't know of any one who has ever met her. And there's not a
soul that can tell what she looks like. It is said that there were
pictures of her in the shop-windows when she first came, but they were
removed immediately. In the morning a great many people are always
lurking around the Springs trying to catch a glimpse of her. I, myself,
have gotten up at six o'clock a couple of times&mdash;on the same errand&mdash;and
if you knew me better, you'd realize what that meant. But not a sign of
her! Either she has the stuff brought to her house or she has the power
of making herself invisible. [<span class="smcap">The Princess</span> <i>turns aside to conceal a
smile</i>.] After that, I used to hang around her garden&mdash;every day, for
hours at a time. Until one day the policeman, whom the managers of the
Springs have stationed at<a name="page_383" id="page_383"></a> the gates, came up to me and asked me what on
earth I was doing there. Well, that was the end of those methods of
approach! Suddenly, however, a happy thought struck me. Now I can see
her and have her near to me as often as I wish.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Why, that's very interesting. How?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Yes, that's just the point. H'm, should I risk it? Should I
take you into my confidence?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. You promised me some time ago that you would show her to
me.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Wait a second. [<i>Looks through the telescope.</i>] There she is.
Please look for yourself.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. But I am&mdash;[<i>She, too, looks through the telescope.</i>]
Actually, there is the garden as plain as if one were in it.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. And at the corner window on the left&mdash;with the
embroidery-frame&mdash;that's she.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Are you absolutely certain that that is the princess?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Why, who else could it be?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Oh, 'round about a princess like that&mdash;there are such a
lot of people. For instance, there is her waiting-woman, there's the
seamstress and her assistants, there's&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. But, my dear young lady, if you only understood anything about
these matters, you would have been certain at the very first glance that
it was she&mdash;and no one else. Observe the nobility in every motion&mdash;the
queenly grace with which she bends over the embroidery-frame&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. How do you know that it's an embroidery-frame?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Why, what should a princess be bending over if not an
embroidery-frame? Do you expect her to be darning stockings?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. It wouldn't hurt her at all!</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Now, that's just one of those petty, bourgeois notions<a name="page_384" id="page_384"></a> which
we ought to suppress. It's not enough that <i>we</i> have to stick in this
misery, but we'd like to drag her down, too&mdash;that being far above all
earthly care&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Oh, dear me!</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. What are you sighing about so terribly?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Tell me, wouldn't you like to have a closer acquaintance
with your princess, some time?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Closer? Why should I? Isn't she close enough to me, my far-away
princess?&mdash;for that's what I call her when I talk to myself about her.
And to have her <i>still</i> closer?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Why, so that you could talk to her and know what she
really was like?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. [<i>Terrified.</i>] Talk to her! Heaven forbid! Goodness gracious,
no! Just see here&mdash;how am I to face a princess? I'm an ordinary fellow,
the son of poor folks. I haven't polished manners&mdash;I haven't even a
decent tailor. A lady like that&mdash;why, she'd measure me from top to toe
in one glance. I've had my lessons in the fine houses where I've applied
as tutor. A glance from boots to cravat&mdash;and you're dismissed!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. And you think that I&mdash;[<i>correcting herself</i>] that this
girl is as superficial as that?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. "This girl"! Dear me, how that sounds! But, how should I ever
succeed in showing her my real self? And even if I should, what would
she care? Oh, yes, if she were like you&mdash;so nice and simple&mdash;and with
such a kindhearted, roguish little twinkle in her eye&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Roguish&mdash;I? Why so?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Because you are laughing at me in your sleeve. And really I
deserve nothing better.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. But your princess deserves something better than your
opinion of her.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. You really ought to try to become acquainted with her some
time.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. No, no, no&mdash;and again no! As long as she remains<a name="page_385" id="page_385"></a> my far-away
princess she is everything that I want her to be&mdash;modest, gracious,
loving. She smiles upon me dreamily. Yes, she even listens when I recite
my poems to her&mdash;and that can't be said of many people! And as soon as I
have finished she sighs, takes a rose from her breast, and casts it down
to the poet. I wrote a few verses yesterday about that rose, that flower
which represents the pinnacle of my desires, as it were.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. [<i>Eagerly.</i>] Oh, yes. Oh, please, please!</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Well, then, here goes. H'm&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="c">"Twenty roses nestling close&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. What? Are there twenty now?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. [<i>Severely.</i>] My princess would not have interrupted me.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Oh, please&mdash;forgive me.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. I shall begin again.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. How nice that is! I've never had any verses written to me
b&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Ah, my dear young lady, ordinary folks like us have to do their
own verse-making!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. And all for one rose! Dear me, how soon it fades! And then
what is left you?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. No, my dear friend, a rose like that never fades&mdash;even as my
love for the gracious giver can never die.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. But you haven't even got it yet!</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. That makes no difference in the end. I'm entirely independent
of such externals. When some day I shall be explaining Ovid to the
beginners, or perhaps even reading Horace with the more advanced
classes&mdash;no, it's better for the present not to think of reaching any
such dizzy heights of greatness&mdash;well, then I shall always be saying to
myself with a smile of satisfaction: "You, too, were one of those
confounded artist fellows&mdash;why, you once went so far as to love a
princess!"</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. And that will make you happy?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Enormously! For what makes us happy, after all? A bit of
happiness? Great heavens, no! Happiness wears out like an old glove.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Well, then, what does?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Ah, how should I know! Any kind of a dream&mdash;a fancy&mdash;a wish
unfulfilled&mdash;a sorrow that we coddle&mdash;some nothing which suddenly
becomes everything to us. I shall always say to my pupils: "Young men,
if you want to be happy as long as you live, create gods for yourselves
in your own image; these gods will take care of your happiness."</p>

<p>The Princess. And what would the god be like that you would create?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. <i>Would be?</i> <i>Is</i>, my dear young lady, <i>is!</i> A man of the world,
a gentleman, well-bred, smiling, enjoying life&mdash;who looks out upon
mankind from under bushy eyebrows, who knows Nietzsche and Stendhal by
heart, and&mdash;[<i>pointing to his shoes</i>] who<a name="page_387" id="page_387"></a> isn't down at the heels&mdash;a
god, in short, worthy of my princess. I know perfectly well that all my
life long I shall never do anything but crawl around on the ground like
an industrious ant, but I know, too, that the god of my fancy will
always take me by the collar when the proper moment comes and pull me up
again into the clouds. Yes, up there I'm safe. And your god, or rather
your goddess&mdash;what would she look like?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. [<i>Thoughtfully.</i>] That's not easy to say. My goddess would
be&mdash;a quiet, peaceful woman who would treasure a secret little joy like
the apple of her eye, who would know nothing of the world except what
she wanted to know, and who would have the strength to make her own
choice when it pleased her.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. But that doesn't seem to me a particularly lofty aspiration, my
dear young lady.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Lofty as the heavens, my friend.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. My princess would be of a different opinion.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Do you think so?</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. For that's merely the ideal of every little country girl.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Not her ideal&mdash;her daily life which she counts as naught.
It is my ideal because I can never attain it.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Oh, I say, my dear young girl! It can't be as bad as that! A
young girl like you&mdash;so charming and&mdash;I don't want to be forward, but if
I could only help you a bit!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Have you got to be helping all the time? Before, it was
only a cheap lunch, now it's actually&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. Yes, yes, I'm an awful donkey, I know, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. [<i>Smiling.</i>] Don't say any more about it, dear friend! I
like you that way.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. [<i>Feeling oppressed by her superiority.</i>] Really, you are an
awfully strange person! There's something about you that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Well?<a name="page_388" id="page_388"></a></p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. I can't exactly define it. Tell me, weren't you wanting to go
into the woods before? It's so&mdash;so oppressive in here.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. Oppressive? I don't find it so at all&mdash;quite the contrary.</p>

<p>S<small>TRÜBEL</small>. No, no&mdash;I'm restless. I don't know what&mdash;at all events, may I
not escort you&mdash;? One can chat more freely, one can express himself more
openly&mdash;if one&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="r">[<i>Takes a deep breath.</i></p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCESS</small>. [<i>Smiling.</i>] And you are leaving your far-away princess

her head</i>.] Or does your Highness mean by it that only the Unreal never

<p class="cb"><a name="AUGUST_STRINDBERG" id="AUGUST_STRINDBERG"></a>AUGUST STRINDBERG</p>

<p>August Strindberg, Sweden's foremost dramatist, was born at Stockholm in
1849. He attended the University of Upsala but did not graduate. In 1872
he wrote <i>Master Olaf</i>, which was for six years steadily refused by
managers. When it did appear it inaugurated the Swedish dramatic
renascence. By turns Strindberg was schoolmaster, journalist, dramatist,
writer of scientific and political treatises, and writer of short
stories. In 1883 he left Sweden and travelled extensively in Denmark,
Germany, France, and Italy. He died in 1912.</p>

<p>As a dramatist Strindberg's chief strength lies not so much in dramatic
technique as it does in his trenchant and searching power of analysis of
the human mind. His chief plays are very exact and narrow views of the
feminine soul. Some of his own domestic bitterness finds expression in
the feminine studies in his plays. He is very fond of showing the power
of one character over another.</p>

<p>His important one-act plays are <i>The Outlaw</i>, <i>Countess Julie</i>,
<i>Creditors</i>, <i>Pariah</i>, <i>Facing Death</i>, and <i>The Stronger</i>. <i>The
Stronger</i> has a dramatic intensity that few plays possess. Though but
one character speaks, the souls of three are skilfully laid bare.<a name="page_396" id="page_396"></a></p>

<p class="hang">SCENE: <i>A corner of a ladies' restaurant; two small tables of
cast-iron, a sofa covered with red plush, and a few chairs.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Mrs. X.</span> <i>enters, dressed in hat and winter coat, and carrying a
pretty Japanese basket on her arm</i>.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Miss Y.</span> <i>has in front of her a partly emptied bottle of beer; she
is reading an illustrated weekly, and every now and then, she

<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. X</small>. Well, how do, Millie! Here you are sitting on Christmas Eve, as
lonely as a poor bachelor.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Miss Y.</span> <i>looks up from the paper for a moment, nods, and resumes
her reading</i>.]</p></div>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. X</small>. Really, I feel sorry to find you like this&mdash;alone&mdash;alone in a
restaurant, and on Christmas Eve of all times. It makes me as sad as
when I saw a wedding party at Paris once in a restaurant&mdash;the bride was
reading a comic paper and the groom was playing billiards with the
witnesses. Ugh, when it begins that way, I thought, how will it end?
Think of it, playing billiards on his wedding day! Yes, and you're going
to say that she was reading a comic paper&mdash;- that's a different case, my
dear.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>A waitress brings a cup of chocolate, places it before</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. X.</span>,

<p>M<small>RS</small>. X</small>. [<i>Sips a few spoonfuls; opens the basket and displays a number
of Christmas presents.</i>] See what I've bought for my<a name="page_398" id="page_398"></a> tots. [<i>Picks up a
doll.</i>] What do you think of this? Lisa is to have it. She can roll her
eyes and twist her head, do you see? Fine, is it not? And here's a cork
pistol for Carl.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Loads the pistol and pops it at</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Y.</span> <span class="smcap">Miss Y.</span> <i>starts as if
frightened</i>.</p></div>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. X</small>. Did I scare you? Why, you didn't fear I was going to shoot you,
did you? Really, I didn't think you could believe that of me. If you
were to shoot <i>me</i>&mdash;well, that wouldn't surprise me the least. I've got
in your way once, and I know you'll never forget it&mdash;but I couldn't help
it. You still think I intrigued you away from the Royal Theatre, and I
didn't do anything of the kind&mdash;although you think so. But it doesn't
matter what I say, of course&mdash;you believe it was I just the same.
[<i>Pulls out a pair of embroidered slippers.</i>] Well, these are for my
hubby&mdash;tulips&mdash;I've embroidered them myself. H'm!&mdash;I hate tulips&mdash;and he
must have them on everything.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Miss Y.</span> <i>looks up from the paper with an expression of mingled
sarcasm and curiosity</i>.</p></div>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. X</small>. [<i>Puts a hand in each slipper.</i>] Just see what small feet Bob
has. See? And you should see him walk&mdash;elegant! Of course, you've never
seen him in slippers.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Miss Y.</span> <i>laughs aloud</i>.</p></div>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. X</small>. Look here&mdash;here he comes.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Makes the slippers walk across the table.</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Y.</span> <i>laughs
again</i>.</p></div>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. X</small>. Then he gets angry, and he stamps his foot just like this:
"Blame that cook who can't learn how to make coffee." Or: "The
idiot&mdash;now that girl has forgotten to fix my study lamp again." Then
there is a draught through the floor and his feet get cold. "Gee, but
it's freezing, and those blanked idiots don't even know enough to keep
the house warm."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She rubs the sole of one slipper against the instep of the
other.</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Y.</span> <i>breaks into prolonged laughter</i>.</p></div>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. X</small>. And then he comes home and has to hunt for his<a name="page_399" id="page_399"></a> slippers&mdash;Mary
has pushed them under the bureau. Well, perhaps it is not right to be
making fun of one's own husband. He's pretty good for all that&mdash;a real
dear little hubby, that's what he is. You should have such a
husband&mdash;what are you laughing at? Can't you tell? Then, you see, I know
he is faithful. Yes, I know, for he has told me himself&mdash;what in the
world makes you giggle like that? That nasty Betty tried to get him away
from me while I was on the road. Can you think of anything more
infamous? [<i>Pause.</i>] But I'd have scratched the eyes out of her face,
that's what I'd have done, if I had been at home when she tried it.
[<i>Pause.</i>] I'm glad Bob told me all about it, so I didn't have to hear
it first from somebody else. [<i>Pause.</i>] And, just think of it, Betty was
not the only one! I don't know why it is, but all women seem to be crazy
after my husband. It must be because they imagine his government
position gives him something to say about the engagements. Perhaps
you've tried it yourself&mdash;you may have set your traps for him, too? Yes,
I don't trust you very far&mdash;but I know he never cared for you&mdash;and then
I have been thinking you rather had a grudge against him.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Pause. They look at each other in an embarrassed manner.</i></p></div>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. X</small>. Amelia, spend the evening with us, won't you? Just to show that
you are not angry&mdash;not with me, at least. I cannot tell exactly why, but
it seems so awfully unpleasant to have you&mdash;you&mdash;for an enemy. Perhaps
because I got in your way that time [<i>rallentando</i>] or&mdash;I don't
know&mdash;really, I don't know at all&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Pause.</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Y.</span> <i>gazes searchingly at</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. X.</span></p></div>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. X</small>. [<i>Thoughtfully.</i>] It was so peculiar, the way our
acquaintance&mdash;why, I was afraid of you when I first met you; so afraid
that I did not dare to let you out of sight. It didn't matter where I
tried to go&mdash;I always found myself near you. I didn't have the courage
to be your enemy&mdash;and so I became your friend. But there was always
something discordant in the air<a name="page_400" id="page_400"></a> when you called at our home, for I saw
that my husband didn't like you&mdash;and it annoyed me&mdash;just as it does when
a dress won't fit. I've tried my very best to make him appear friendly
to you at least, but I couldn't move him&mdash;not until you were engaged.
Then you two became such fast friends that it almost looked as if you
had not dared to show your real feelings before, when it was not
safe&mdash;and later&mdash;let me see, now! I didn't get jealous&mdash;strange, was it
not? And I remember the baptism&mdash;you were acting as godmother, and I
made him kiss you&mdash;and he did, but both of you looked terribly
embarrassed&mdash;that is, I didn't think of it then&mdash;or afterwards, even&mdash;I
never thought of it&mdash;till&mdash;<i>now</i>! [<i>Rises impulsively.</i>] Why don't you
say something? You have not uttered a single word all this time. You've
just let me go on talking. You've been sitting there staring at me only,
and your eyes have drawn out of me all these thoughts which were lying
in me like silk in a cocoon&mdash;thoughts&mdash;bad thoughts maybe&mdash;let me think.
Why did you break your engagement? Why have you never called on us
afterward? Why don't you want to be with us to-night?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Miss Y.</span> <i>makes a motion as if intending to speak</i>.</p></div>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. X</small>. No, you don't need to say anything at all. All is clear to me
now. So, that's the reason of it all. Yes, yes! Everything fits together
now. Shame on you! I don't want to sit at the same table with you.
[<i>Moves her things to another table.</i>] That's why I must put those
hateful tulips on his slippers&mdash;because you love them. [<i>Throws the
slippers on the floor.</i>] That's why we have to spend the summer in the
mountains&mdash;because you can't bear the salt smell of the ocean; that's
why my boy had to be called Eskil&mdash;because that was your father's name;
that's why I had to wear your color, and read your books, and eat your
favorite dishes, and drink your drinks&mdash;this chocolate, for instance;
that's why&mdash;great heavens!&mdash;it's terrible to think of it&mdash;it's terrible!
Everything was forced on me by you&mdash;even your passions. Your soul bored
itself into mine as a worm into<a name="page_401" id="page_401"></a> an apple, and it ate and ate and
burrowed and burrowed, till nothing was left but the outside shell and a
little black dust. I wanted to run away from you, but I couldn't. You
were always on hand like a snake, with your black eyes, to charm me&mdash;I
felt how my wings beat the air only to drag me down&mdash;I was in the water
with my feet tied together, and the harder I worked with my arms, the
further down I went&mdash;down, down, till I sank to the bottom, where you
lay in wait like a monster crab to catch me with your claws&mdash;and now I'm
there! Shame on you! How I hate you, hate you, hate you! But you, you
just sit there, silent and calm and indifferent, whether the moon is new
or full; whether it's Christmas or mid-summer; whether other people are
happy or unhappy. You are incapable of hatred and you don't know how to
love. As a cat in front of a mouse-hole, you are sitting there. You
can't drag your prey out, and you can't pursue it, but you can outwait
it. Here you sit in this comer&mdash;do you know they've nicknamed it "the
mousetrap" on your account? Here you read the papers to see if anybody
is in trouble, or if anybody is about to be discharged from the theatre.
Here you watch your victims and calculate your chances and take your
tributes. Poor Amelia! Do you know, I pity you all the same, for I know
you are unhappy&mdash;unhappy as one who has been wounded, and malicious
because you are wounded. I ought to be angry with you, but really I
can't&mdash;you are so small, after all&mdash;and as to Bob, why, that does not
bother me in the least. What does it matter to me, anyhow? If you or
somebody else taught me to drink chocolate&mdash;what of that? [<i>Takes a
spoonful of chocolate; then, sententiously.</i>] They say chocolate is very
wholesome. And if I have learned from you how to dress&mdash;<i>tant
mieux!</i>&mdash;it has only given me a stronger hold on my husband&mdash;and you
have lost where I have gained. Yes, judging by several signs, I think
you have lost him already. Of course, you meant me to break with him&mdash;as
you did, and as you are now regretting&mdash;but, you see, <i>I</i><a name="page_402" id="page_402"></a> never would
do that. It wouldn't do to be narrow-minded, you know. And why should I
take only what nobody else wants? Perhaps, after all, I am the stronger
now. You never got anything from me; you merely gave&mdash;and thus happened
to me what happened to the thief&mdash;I had what you missed when you woke
up. How explain in any other way that, in your hand, everything proved
worthless and useless? You were never able to keep a man's love, in
spite of your tulips and your passions&mdash;and I could; you could never
learn the art of living from the books&mdash;as I learned it; you bore no
little Eskil, although that was your father's name. And why do you keep
silent always and everywhere&mdash;silent, ever silent? I used to think it
was because you were so strong; and maybe the simple truth was you never
had anything to say&mdash;because you were unable to think! [<i>Rises and picks
up the slippers.</i>] I'm going home now&mdash;I'll take the tulips with
me&mdash;your tulips. You couldn't learn anything from others; you couldn't
bend&mdash;and so you broke like a dry stem&mdash;and I didn't. Thank you, Amelia,
for all your instructions. I thank you that you have taught me how to
love my husband. Now I'm going home&mdash;to him!</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
